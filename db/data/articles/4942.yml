title: A rake task for tracking your time with git
body: "Are you using Ruby on Rails?  Are you using Git?  Do you have a need to track
  how long you spend on things?  Then I have just the thing for you.\r\n\r\nI threw
  together a quick rake task that gets all of your commits in a git repo and  parses
  out the times and commit message from them.  Then it formats them with the time
  and also the time interval between them.  You can get the [rake task to track your
  time from this gist][gist].\r\n\r\nThe output will look something like this:\r\n\r\n

  doesn't actually truncate the commit messages, I just did that here to make each
  one fit on a line.  If the time interval is over 24 hours, it doesn't bother printing
  the interval, because you probably didn't actually work on that one commit for 37
  hours straight.  I've been thinking if you really want to track time this way then
  each time you sit down to start hacking on a project, you just make a minor change
  to the .gitignore or something and then commit it with a message like \"started
  hacking on foo\", so then when you commit your first chunk of actual work, you will
  know how long you spend on that.\r\n\r\n[gist]: http://bit.ly/rake-git-time-tracker\r\n"
