title: Ajax Desktops
body: "There's an article on <a href=\"http://blogs.zdnet.com/Hinchcliffe/?p=8\">ZDNet</a>
  discussing AJAX Desktops.  AJAX is kind of another word for the Web 2.0, which is
  the idea that web applications are now becoming more interactive, more like desktop
  apps.  I'm currently reading <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com\">Paul Graham's</a>
  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596006624/102-4070241-6151323?n=283155\">Hackers
  &amp; Painters</a>, and in <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/road.html\">Chapter
  5</a> he discusses the idea fully web-based desktop that would appeal to typical
  internet users who just want to read email, browse the web, compose documents and
  spredsheets, and maybe a few other basic features.  I think that this might ultimately
  be where AJAX Desktops & the Web 2.0 are headed.  \r\n\r\nThey're not there yet,
  because AJAX desktop are mostly for organizing data from various websites.  But
  think about this:  For $20 per month, with a 12-month subscription, you get internet
  access and a free \"web terminal\".  The \"web terminal\" is just a flat screen
  monitor, with a keyboard and mouse, ethernet connection, and maybe a few USB ports.
  \ It has no hard drive, and when you boot it, it connects to the internet, you login
  and it loads your desktop.  Nothing is saved locally, when you save a file, it just
  uploads it to the internet.  If one company can provide all of this for one price,
  they could be on to something."
