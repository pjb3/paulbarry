title: Comparing Ruby, Java, Perl, and Lisp Syntax
body: "I was reading [Peter Cooper's \"8 Easy to Follow Ruby Presentations\"][cooper]
  article, which links to some Ruby presentations on [SlideShare.net][slideshare].
  \       I liked one particular bit of geek humor from one of the slides of [Yukihiro
  Matsumoto's \"The Top 10 Reasons The Ruby Programming Language Sucks\"][matz].  There's
  no sound, but you can guess from the context that he is trying to show how Ruby's
  syntax is cleaner than that of other languages:  \r\n\r\n    Compare with other
  languages:\r\n\r\n    - Ruby: puts \"Hello world!\"\r\n    - Java: threeVeryLongLines.weHopeWork
  ...\r\n    - Perl: #$<!&;\r\n    - Lisp: ((a(((b)))(c)))\r\n\r\nI'm sure it's meant
  more as a joke, but as always, there's some truth as the basis for the joke.\r\n\r\n[cooper]:
