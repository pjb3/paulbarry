title: Quick and Dirty Git Repository
body: "Do you have an app you want to keep in version control, put you don't want
  to put it on Github?  Well, you can obviously use git to keep track of your versions,
  but do you want some way to back it up?  Do you have a server you plan to deploy
  the app to already setup with SSH keys and everything?  Assuming you already have
  git installed on both your machine and the remote machine, here's all you need to
  do:\r\n\r\n1. Create The Remote Git Repo\r\n\r\n        $ ssh yourusername@yourserver.com\r\n
  \       $ mkdir yourproject.git\r\n        $ cd yourproject.git\r\n        $ git
  --bare init\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Create The Local Git Repo, If You Haven't Already\r\n\r\n
  \       $ git init\r\n        $ git add .\r\n        $ git commit -a \"Initial Checkin\"\r\n
  \   \r\n3. Add The Remote Repo\r\n\r\n        $ git remote add origin yourusername@yourserver.com:yourproject.git\r\n
  \   \r\n4. Push To the Remote Repo\r\n\r\n        $ git push origin master\r\n    \r\nNow
  you have a full copy of the repo locally and on the server.\r\n"
