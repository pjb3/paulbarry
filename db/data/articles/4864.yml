title: Unlimited.....yeah, right
body: "There is a story Slashdot saying that [Yahoo! plans to offer web hosting with
  unlimited bandwidth and storage for $11.95 a month][slashdot].  My first reaction
  is the [story is a misquote by Computerworld][computerworld] of somekind and Yahoo
  will release a statement soon enough to clarify it.  Yahoo doesn't strike me as
  a company dumb enough to try to pull a stunt like this, it seems more like something
  you expected to see coming out of Redmond.  \r\n\r\nBut just to play devil's advocate
  in case this turns out to be true, here are two snippets from the first two comments
  that sum it up:\r\n\r\n> Anybody who's had experience in the past with any company
  who offers \"unlimited\" knows better- Anybody remember Comcast \"unlimited\" broadband?\r\n\r\nAnd:\r\n\r\n>
  Dear Yahoo,\r\n>\r\n> You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you
  think it does.\r\n\r\nWhat gives companies the the right to just say complete lies
  and then contradict it in the terms and conditions?  How is this not false advertising?\r\n\r\nSay
  for a minute that Verizon Wireless decided to offer a calling plan called \"Unlimited
  Calling\", saying \"Make as many calls you want for as long as you want\", but then
  in the fine print of the agreement, it says 'Verizon Wireless reserves the right
  to terminate your contract at any time if you use an \"excessive\" amount of airtime.
  \ \"Excessive\" is defined as over 5000 minutes in one calendar month'.\r\n\r\nI
  would hope that would be considered false advertising, but it's the exact same thing
  as what Yahoo is doing.  You can even start to see that language in this quote from
  the article:\r\n\r\n> Yalif said the service is not designed to be a \"hard drive\"
  in the sky but rather a mechanism to help the small business users quickly get in
  line with growing online demands. He said Yahoo will monitor the service to prevent
  any illegal activities.   \r\n\r\ntranslation:\r\n\r\n\"You get unlimited service,
  but if you actually use it a lot, we'll take it away from you\".\r\n\r\n[slashdot]:
