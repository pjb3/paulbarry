title: 'Programming: You''re Doing It Wrong'
body: "In giving the [rational for Clojure][clj-rationale], Rich Hickey makes some
  pretty bold claims against Object-Oriented programming, and this one specifically
  caught my attention:\r\n\r\n> Object Orientation is overrated ... Mutable stateful
  objects are the new spaghetti code, hard to understand, test, reason about\r\n\r\nThis
  claim has always been the most interesting thing about Clojure to me.  When I first
  started learning C++ and Java about 12 years ago, something I was taught was that
  Object-Oriented programming is the key to designing re-usable, maintainable software.
  \ One of the things I love about Ruby is that it is a much purer Object-Oriented
  language than Java.  Unlike Java, everything, including Numbers, Arrays, and Classes,
  is an object.\r\n\r\nBut when I came across Clojure, this jumped out me.  Here is
  a language where one of the guiding design principles is that it would be not Object-Oriented.
