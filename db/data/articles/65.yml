title: What Rhapsody Should Be
body: "I posted this over on <a href=\"http://gadiel.com\">Andy Gadiel's blog</a>
  in response to <a href=\"http://www.gadiel.com/2006/08/why-dont-you-use-rhapsody.html\">Why
  Don't You Use Rhapsody?</a>  Since blogger doesn't appear to have trackbacks, I
  am re-posting it here.\r\n\r\nI am a <a href=\"http://www.rhapsody.com\">rhapsody</a>
  subscriber.  I agree with you, having access to all that music is great, and has
  actually developed into something I need.  Music is one of the most important reasons
  that I own a computer that is connected to the Internet, second only to general
  Internet use (email, google, wikipedia, blogs, etc.).  But that being said, I am
  frustrated with Rhapsody for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n1.  I am a linux user, would
  love to use ubuntu as my only operating system, but an forced to live the life of
  dual-boot do to the lack of any quality music subscription service.  As you mentioned,
  Mac users are in this same boat too.\r\n\r\n2.  I hate DRM.  I don't care how flexible
  the DRM rights are, I just don't like the idea of it.  When I buy a CD, I can listen
  to it on as many stereos as I like and make as many copies as I like.  That's the
  way digital music should be.  I can sort of accomplish this with rhapsody, by buying
  songs for $.89 each, or cheaper sometimes if I buy the whole album (not too bad
  a price), burn the songs to a CD, and then rip them to 128kbps, non-DRM MP3s.  Still,
  more work than it should be, just sell me the 128kbps MP3 and make my life easier.\r\n\r\n3.
  \ I have found their software to be buggy.  I have been so far unsuccessful in trying
  to get Rhapsody-to-go to work with my supposedly supported mp3 player.  Burning
  CDs never seems to work like it should, there's always some problem, whether it
  be authorizing my computer, getting the files to download, whatever.\r\n\r\nSo here's
  the deal:\r\n\r\nSomebody (Google, I'm looking at you), develop a web-based site
  that allows me to listen to every song ever recorded over the Internet for $9.99
  per month.  I say web-based because I don't want to install any funky software or
  anything, especially because I know that software will only run on windows.  Just
  allow me to queue up the URLs of MP3 files in my MP3 player of choice (such as winamp,
  xmms, etc., like you can do now on <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/etree\">the
  Live Music Archive</a>.  I'm sure you can figure out some way of authenticating
  my account when I hit the mp3 URLs (cookies?).  Then, let me purchase the songs
  on an individual basis or the whole album.  Make sure to keep the prices competitive
  to.  Remember, I can buy a lot of used CDs from amazon.com and probably a whole
  bunch of other sites for $5-$7 per CD.  I can rip those songs to MP3 and then donate
  the CD to the library.  The songs should be available in a variety of formats, my
  number 1 choice being 128kbps MP3s, but flac and ogg would probably be a good idea
  too.  Whatever the formats you have, make sure they are all DRM-free.  \r\n\r\nThat's
  it.  Once you've got that, goodbye rhapsody, hello gmusic.  Drop the whole concept
  of music-to-go.  If I want to listen to music on my MP3 player, I'll buy the songs
  in regular MP3 format and transfer them, especially if I can just download the 128kbps
  MP3s with one-click (skipping the painful, download > Burn CD > rip to MP3 process
  necessary with Rhapsody now).  This should be a lot easier on you, not having to
  try to support some weird DRM format on a gazillion different MP3 players, only
  to find out that Jon Johansen has cracked your DRM format 3 months after you release
  it.  I'm a legitimate music consumer willing to pay for non-DRM music and not instantly
  upload all those songs to Kazaa or whatever the virsus-ridden, P2P network is the
  most popular these days.  So that's my $.02, I'm off to <a href=\"http://livephish.com\">livephish.com</a>
  to get the <a href=\"http://www.livephish.com/show.asp?show=391\">GRAB show</a>."
