title: Hibernate vs. iBatis
body: "I was googling for something on the internet and cam across [this post][1]
  I made to the iBatis mailing list almost 2 years ago.  I think for the most part
  this still holds true, although when I made this statement I was referring to Hibernate
  2.  Hibernate 3 has some features that make Hibernate even more usable for odd database
  structures, such as [the ability to map SQL queries to objects][2].  The criteria
  API is much improved in Hibernate 3, and Hibernate Annotations make configuration
  of Hibernate much easier.  I think these feature make the argument for using Hibernate
  even stronger, but iBatis is still a great framework to use for certain scenarios.\r\n\r\n[1]:
