title: 5 Rails Tips
body: "Ryan Bates, the author of [Railscasts][railscasts], just reached his 100th
  episode.  Railscasts is a fantastic free resource for learning about Ruby on Rails.
  \ Congratulations, Ryan! \r\n\r\nTo celebrate his 100th episode, he's running a
  [contest][railscasts-contest] with some great prizes.  The contest is to submit
  your own 5 Rails tips, much like Ryan did in [Episode 100 of Railscasts][rc-100].
  \ This blog post is my entry into that contest.  I have posted 5 articles today
  which include tips on various aspects of Rails.  They are:\r\n\r\n1.  [Sending Liquid-based
  Email with Rails][tip1]\r\n\r\n    Find out how to let the administrative users
  of your application update email templates.\r\n\r\n2.  [Importing Data with Rails][tip2]\r\n\r\n
  \   Learn how to use Rails and object-oriented techniques to import data into your
  Rails app.\r\n\r\n3.  [Serving Images Stored in the Database with Rails][tip3]\r\n\r\n
  \   See how to take advantage of Rails' page caching to serve images that are stored
  in your database.\r\n\r\n4.  [Using ActiveRecord Composed Of][tip4]\r\n\r\n    Make
  use of the `composed_of` feature in ActiveRecord to treat multiple fields within
  a model as one object.\r\n\r\n5.  [Using Lowpro To Create Autotab using Unobtrusive
  JavaScript and Rails][tip5]\r\n\r\n    Provide your users with an easy shortcut
  for entering in multi-field data types like phone numbers without filling up your
  views with lots of JavaScript code.\r\n\r\nIf you find these tips helpful, be sure
  to let Ryan know! :)\r\n\r\n[railscasts]: http://railscasts.com\r\n[railscasts-contest]:
