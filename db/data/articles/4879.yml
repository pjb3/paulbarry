title: Shell History with Ruby Golf
body: "I saw [this post about Shell History][shell-history] and thought why not try
  to do it in Ruby.  Probably inspired by the fact that [the Masters][masters] underway,
  this became an exercise in [Code Golf][code-golf].  Here's what I came up with:\r\n\r\n
  \   ~ $ history | ruby -e '$<.inject(Hash.new(0)){|h,l| h[l.split[1]] += 1; h}.sort{\r\n
  \       |a,b| b[1]<=>a[1]}[0..9].each{|k,v| puts \"#{v} #{k}\"}'\r\n    138 cd\r\n
  \   55 ls\r\n    40 merb\r\n    31 mate\r\n    29 cat\r\n    19 mv\r\n    17 httperf\r\n
  \   15 rm\r\n    14 ant\r\n    14 rake\r\n\r\nI must admit, the fact that I can't
  fit in on one line in the blog makes me feel slightly defeated.  Can you do better?\r\n\r\n[shell-history]:
