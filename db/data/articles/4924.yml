title: Good Podcasts
body: "Lately on my commute back and for to the Bethesda from Baltimore I've been
  listening to the [Stack Overflow podcast][sopod].  It is hosted by [Jeff Atwood][atwood]
  and [Joel Spolsky][spolsky].  They've had a lot of great guests lately, like [Steve
  Yegge][yegge] and they also have a lot of good conversations about software development
  in general.  One thing I like about listening to this guys is that they are C#,
  ASP.NET, Visual Studio Microsofties, which is the complete polar opposite community
  of the Ruby community.  What technology podcasts are you listening too?\r\n\r\n[sopod]:
