title: Install Web Sites as an Application with Fluid
body: "There is a pretty cool Mac OS X application called [Fluid][fluid].  What it
  allows you to do is run a web site as if it were an application installed on your
  system.  The end result:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3232/2448932311_cc06f3cae5_o.png\"/>\r\n\r\nAll
  those web sites you are logged into on a daily basis show up as separate icons in
  the dock.  For some sites, like Gmail and Google Reader, it shows a label with the
  count of unread items.  It doesn't come will all those nifty icons, you kind of
  have to scour the web for them.  Here's where I found those:\r\n\r\n* [Gmail and
  Facebook][gm-fb]\r\n* [Google Reader][gr]\r\n* [Reddit and del.icio.us][others]\r\n\r\n[fluid]:
