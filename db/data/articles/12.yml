title: Ubuntu
body: 'So I''m about to embark on my 538th attempt to really use Linux as a desktop.  I''ve
  got an extra disk in my computer, so I figure I''ll install Ubuntu on that and see
  how it goes.  I like the fact that Ubuntu seems to have <a href="http://ubuntuguide.org/">good
  documentation for stuff people actually use computers for</a>.  I always thought
  this was lacking with Redhat/Fedora, or any other Linux distro.  The other thing
  I like about Ubuntu it''s really free.  Other distros I tried in the past (Redhat
  and Mandrake, I''m looking at you) were free to download and install, but it was
  a pain to get updates.  You either had to be part of the Redhat Network or the Mandrake
  club.  Ubuntu, not the case.  So we''ll see how this goes.  I''ve download the DVD
  ISO, so step one is figuring out how to burn the ISO to a DVD in Windows. '
