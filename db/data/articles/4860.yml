title: Gittin' with the times
body: "Anyone who keeps up with Rails in blogiverse knows by know that [Git][git]
  is the new hotness.  Once you've got a [peepcode][gitpeep], well, that's it, you've
  got the ultimate endorsement from the Rails community.  I know nothing about Git
  and I have resisted the change up to now, but I ran across [Dr. Nic's new Rails
  2.0 Textmate Bundle][drnic] and figured it was time to git with the times (pun intended).\r\n\r\nSo
  like any good hacker, I google Git, found the download page, downloaded the [latest
  source tarball (1.5.4 as of now)][gittar], decided against reading any documentation
  or instructions and just ran `./configure`, `make`, `make install`.  Even thing
  worked as planed and after following Dr. Nic's instructions, I've got the latest
  Rails 2.0 Textmate bundle.\r\n\r\n[git]: http://git.or.cz\r\n[gitpeep]: http://peepcode.com/products/git\r\n[drnic]:
