title: Is Clojure An Acceptable Lisp?
body: "Almost two years ago now, [Steve Yegge post an article articulating his problems
  with Lisp][yegge].  He finished up the article with:\r\n\r\n> There is no acceptable
  Lisp\r\n\r\n> This is a problem. It's not a little teeny one, either. The Lisp communities
  (yeah, there are a bunch) are going to have to realize that if Lisp is ever going
  to be massively successful, it needs an overhaul. Or maybe a revolution. Contrary
  to what some might tell you, it doesn't need a committee, and it doesn't need a
  bunch of money. Linux proved exactly the opposite. Lisp needs a benevolent dictator.
  Lisp needs to ditch the name \"Lisp\", since it scares people. And Lisp needs to
  learn from the lessons of the 45 years of languages that have followed it.\r\n\r\nSounds
  a lot like [Clojure][clojure].  Do you agree?\r\n\r\n[yegge]: http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/04/lisp-is-not-acceptable-lisp.html\r\n[clojure]:
