title: Active Record Random
body: "Are you looking for a way to select a random record that plays nice with named
  scope in your Rails app?  Throw this into `config/initializers/active_record_random.rb`:\r\n\r\n
  \   class ActiveRecord::Base\r\n      def self.random\r\n        if (c = count)
  > 0\r\n          first(:offset => rand(c)) \r\n        end\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\nNow
  you can call `random` the same way you would call `first` or `all`.  That means
  you can do `Widget.random` to get a random widget or `Widget.fancy.random`, to get
  a random fancy widget, assuming you have defined the fancy named scope for `Widget`."
