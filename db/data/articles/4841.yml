title: MLB fans left out in the cold due to DRM
body: "I'm just posting a a link to this to hopefully raise awareness.  The story
  basically is [MLB sold DRM protected videos in 2006, those videos no longer work
  because the license server is no longer active and MLB has no plans to restore the
  license server or refund customers their money][joyofsox].  This is a great example
  of why DRM is flawed and why I've never purchased DRM protected digital content
  in my life.  \r\n\r\nAnd as for the MLB, my only experience with them was a trial
  period for their MLB TV product.  I had to give a credit card number to activate
  the trial, which I never should have done.  The service did not work well, probably
  due to my bandwidth, but I knew I didn't want it.  I sent an email to have my trial
  canceled immediately.  I sent follow up  emails to make sure the trial was canceled
  and sure enough, once the trial period ended, my card was charged anyway.  Bottom
  line, don't pay any money to access any of MLB's digital content, they have no clue
  what they are doing. \r\n\r\n[joyofsox]: http://joyofsox.blogspot.com/2007/11/mlb-game-downloads-still-inaccessible.html"
