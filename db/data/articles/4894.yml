title: Displaying error messages in RSpec failures
body: "The [suggested way of checking if an ActiveRecord model has errors with RSpec][rspec]
  is:\r\n\r\n    @something.errors.should be_empty  \r\n    \r\nWhen that fails, you
  get a report that says:\r\n\r\n    expected empty? to return true, got false\r\n\r\nThat's
  not very helpful because it doesn't tell you what the errors are.  If you do this:\r\n\r\n
  \   @something.errors.full_messages.should == []      \r\n\r\nYou get a more informative
  failure message:\r\n\r\n    expected: [],\r\n    got: [\"Whatever can't be blank\"]
  (using ==)\r\n\r\n[rspec]: http://rspec.info/documentation/rails/writing/models.html"
