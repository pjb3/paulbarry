title: Stripes Book from the Pragmatic Programmers
body: "It's really good to see a [book][book] being published by the [Pragmatic Programmers][prag]
  on the [Stripes][stripes], even if it is too little, too late.  I wrote [an article
  on Stripes][pb] a few years ago, and actually, I still like how Stripes handles
  mapping request parameters to an object graph, but since then I have discovered
  the benefits of dynamic languages like Ruby, so I would never consider using a framework
  like Stripes, just because it means programming in Java.  When I was doing Java,
  I felt that Stripes was a much better framework than WebWork/Struts, but for some
  reason flew under the radar.  In fact, this blog is built using Stripes.  Stripes'
  creator Tim Fennell always did an excellent job answering questions on the mailing
  list and deserved more recognition from the Java community as a whole.\r\n\r\nIt's
  surprising to see this book coming out now.  Frankly, straight Java as a web development
  language is yesterday's technology, the Cobol of our generation.  The JVM is still
  alive an well, with many great options, such as JRuby, Groovy, Scala and the best
  of them all, [Clojure][clojure].  I would love to see a Pragmatic Programmer book
  on Clojure, just to give some more attention to Clojure, because it is such a great
  language.  Anyway, congrats to Tim Fennell, Frederic Daoud and the Stripes team
  on finally getting some acknowledgment for building a great framework and a great
  community. \r\n\r\n[book]: http://www.pragprog.com/titles/fdstr/stripes\r\n[prag]:
