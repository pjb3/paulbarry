  alt=\"Top Ten Things That Suck About the iPhone 3G\"/>\r\n\r\nFor the most part
  I'm pretty happy with my new iPhone 3G, so this is meant to be constructive criticism.
  \ I don't even compare my iPhone to the simple run-of-the-mill phone I was using
  before.  That was a true cell phone, this is a handle-held computer that you can
  make phone calls with.\r\n\r\n**10. No Internet Connection Sharing**\r\n\r\nIt would
  be nice to be able to connect to the internet on a Macbook that has an iPhone connected
  to it.\r\n\r\n**9. No Finder**\r\n\r\nThe standard web file upload capability is
  disabled.  It would be nice if there were an [iPhone Finder app][finder], that let
  you browse through a hierarchy of all files saved on the iPhone, including photos,
  mp3s, apps, mail attachments, etc.  Also maybe have some way of transferring documents
  like PDFs to the iPhone, and some way of viewing them as well as being able to upload
  them to websites.\r\n\r\n**8. Video Recording**\r\n\r\nIt would be really nice to
  be able to record and upload videos, even have live video chat, but I'm sure that's
  a hardware/bandwidth limitation for now.\r\n\r\n**7. Lack of Openness**\r\n\r\nThe
  iPhone SDK NDA has some pretty silly restrictions in it, as you can see from [Prag
  Dave's recent fiasco][iphone-sdk].  Also, to distribute apps on the App Store, you
  must pay $99 for a developer's license, even if you plan to give away your app for
  free.  The fact is the Apple often behaves in the same monopolistic ways the Microsoft
  does, but we generally give them a pass on it because they make great products.
  \ It's like the typical story of the young upstart revolutionist gaining the support
  of the people to overthrow the evil dictator, only to become the next evil dictator
  himself.  Expect the anit-mac fanboy, free as in speech, Slashdot crew to jump all
  over this once the [Android project][android] gets some traction.\r\n\r\n**6. Stability**\r\n\r\nApps
  crash with some regularity and the whole OS will crash and restart as well sometimes.
  \ The iPhone needs less crashes and when it does crash, crashing a little more gracefully
  would be nice.\r\n\r\n**5. Flash**\r\n\r\nIf you could install Flash, you could
  watch embedded videos from Vimeo, Blip.TV, ESPN Videos, etc.  Also, if you could
  install Silverlight, you could watch MLB.TV, but that one is MLB.TV's fault, they
  should have a native iPhone App.  3G probably doesn't give you enough bandwidth,
  but it would still be nice to watch live baseball games when connected to WiFi.\r\n\r\n**4.
  Real GPS**\r\n\r\nI don't know if it's a technical limitation or not, but we need
  a TomTom/Garmin/VZ Navigator quality turn-by-turn, voice narrated GPS directions
  app.  My crappy samsung phone had that:\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param
  name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/yurqFgTIm3c&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param
  name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/yurqFgTIm3c&hl=en&fs=1\"
  type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\n**3.
  AT&T**\r\n\r\nI switched to the iPhone from Verizon.  Quality of service is much
  worse, I barely get a signal in my own house, which is a mile from downtown Baltimore.
  \ So much for more bars in more places.\r\n\r\n**2. Copy & Paste**\r\n\r\nThe biggest
  reason I need copy & paste is for passwords.  For password management, I use Password
  Gorilla, which totally sucks, but runs on Windows and Mac.  A password manager is
  a trivial app to write, so I would create one myself, but without cut & paste, there's
  no way to make it work.  Even if you had cut & paste, you would need the next item.\r\n\r\n**1.
  No Multitasking**\r\n\r\nFor example, I want to have Pandora running in the background
  while I check my email.  I want to be logged into AIM so people can IM me while
  I'm doing something else.  I want to be notified when I have new mail.  I want the
  Twittervision and NetNewsWire icons to update to show me there are unread items,
  but they can't until you can run more than one app at the same time.\r\n\r\nWhat
  I want is Command+Tab.  You know how in Safari you press the bottom right button
  and you can see all your pages, switch from one to the next?  That's what you need
  for the whole OS.  You press the home button (the actual only real button, is that
  called the home button?) and instead of closing the app you are running and taking
  you back to the home screen, it gives you the Command+Tab/Safari like view of all
  running apps.  You slide from one app to the next and pick which one to bring to
  the foreground.  You press the home button again, then it takes you home.  Combine
  that with Cut & Paste and the result would be a serious workflow/usability improvement.\r\n\r\nI
  realize this means the OS needs better memory management and the hardware needs
  more RAM, but I confident Apple can make that happen.\r\n\r\n[finder]: http://ifapp.wordpress.com/2008/07/03/idisk-is-the-new-finder-finder-in-iphone-4/\r\n[iphone-sdk]:
