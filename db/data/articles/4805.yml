title: Stopping spam with Ajax
body: "Over the last week or so I've started to get a lot of spam comments.  I get
  about 25-50 per day.  Luckily I have a decent interface on the backend for removing
  it.  First of all, I have the [RSS feed for my comments][rss], so I find out in
  google reader when I get spam.  Then, I have a page in the admin interface where
  it lists all comments of all articles, showing the most recent first.  This allows
  me to find the recent spam comments easily.  It sounds simple, but [Typo][typo]
  didn't have it, which made it very difficult to delete spam via the admin interface.\r\n\r\nEven
  with that, it's still annoying and I've been wondering if I can find some way to
  reduce the spam.  I want to avoid things that require users to do anything, such
  as captcha or logging in.  So what I've done is make it so that the request must
  be an XmlHttpRequest in order to allow the comment to be posted.  Any real person
  trying to leave a comment is going to be using a modern browser with JavaScript
  enabled, so the comment will go through.  My hope is that spam bots will won't know
  to do that and less spam will get through.  I'm also hoping that the people who
  spam my blog don't actually read it, otherwise they'll now know how to defeat this.
  \ This probably isn't going to be very effective, but its better than nothing.  If
  you have any problems leaving a comment, let me know by sending an email to \"mail\"
  at this domain.\r\n\r\n[rss]: http://paulbarry.com/articles/2007/01/31/rss-feed-for-comments\r\n[typo]:
