title: Miro+BlipTV = The Future of Television
body: "Just yesterday I was talking to Eileen about the future of television.  I was
  saying how the Internet will put companies that sell access to cable TV programming
  that contains advertising out of business.  TV will either be free with advertising,
  or will have some kind of paid subscription access.  The tools already exist.  For
  TV, check out the program [Miro][miro].  It allows you to subscribe to video channels,
  which are basically podcasts with video content.  They get updated automatically,
  new episodes are download to your hard drive for you to watch whenever.  \r\n\r\nAnother
  nice feature is that you can search video networks like YouTube, Google Video, etc.
  for video content and download the videos from within the program.  They have several
  video networks on there, but not every site you will come across on the Internet.
  \ For example, the site [Monkey See][monkeysee], which has really good instructional
  content, like [playing Jazz guitar][jazz], but unfortunately you can't download
  it via Miro, hopefully you will be able too soon.\r\n\r\nThe other player in the
  game is the TV channel providers, like [Blip][blip].  You can, for free, create
  a channel and upload new episodes for free.  Blip is similar to YouTube, but with
  higher quality video and it is more oriented toward the concept of a channel, where
  you continuously post new episodes.\r\n\r\nThis model is a lot like how Tivo works,
  but instead of waiting for a video to be played on a TV channel and recording it,
  the video is just published to the Internet and you download it whenever.  This
  is better because everything is archived, you can always go back and grab a video,
  even if you didn't record it when it originally aired.\r\n\r\nThere are a few pieces
  of the puzzle that I think still need to get worked out.\r\n\r\n1.  Connection to
  TV\r\n\r\n    People have giant 60\" Flat Screen TV that they want to use.  Miro
  needs to partner with someone to make an AppleTV like device that allows you to
  set up your subscriptions from your computer using Miro, but then watch videos from
  your TV.\r\n\r\n2.  Video Quality\r\n\r\n    This is just a matter of time.  A combination
  of factors inclusing camera quality and bandwidth limitations now cause videos on
  YouTube to look horrible.  In 10-20 years, these videos will be considered the Black
  & White equivalent of the Internet TV era.\r\n\r\n3.  Live Video\r\n\r\n    There
  needs to be some method of viewing live content for things like News and Sports
  via Miro.\r\n\r\n4.  Subscription Model\r\n\r\n    As we have known for years, there
  are 2 methods for content providers to make money and that is by charging for access
  to your channels (like HBO) or by providing access for free, but showing advertising
  during the shows (NBC).  Then there are evil cable network (like ESPN) that do both.\r\n\r\n
  \   There needs to be a model for providing access to paid channels.  For example,
  I would love it if I could pay $10 a month for access to [Peepcode][peepcode] and
  just have it automatically download the videos through Miro.  I think a standard
  practice for this will emerge, and hopefully one that doesn't involve DRM.\r\n\r\n
  \   I would love to see cable TV move to this model, where each provider would sell
  access to channels, even shows, a la carte, with no commericals, and have it in
  a method where you can subscribe via Miro and have it notify you of new episodes
  and downloads them automatically.\r\n\r\nThere are also larger social, global issues
  involved here too.  I just got my [OLPC][olpc] in the mail yesterday.  I haven't
  had a chance to play with it too much yet, but it seems pretty cool and the [philosophy][olpc-mission]
  of the project is great.  If we could have people all over the world with a laptop
  that has Miro and Skype installed and access to the internet, it could have a big
  impact on the way people learn and the way governments are able to oppress people.
