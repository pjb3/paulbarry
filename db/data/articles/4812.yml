title: Could RDoc be more like JavaDoc?
body: "JavaDocs tell you all the methods a class has, as well as the methods it has
  via inheiritence, and precisely which object it inheirts that method from, and links
  to the docs for that method.\r\n\r\nExample, ActiveRecord::Base::columns\r\n\r\n>Returns
  an array of column objects for the table associated with this class.\r\n\r\nWhat
  does column objects mean?  Where's the documentation for a column object?  \r\n\r\nIt
  turns out that this each column object is a child of `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::Column`,
  which has `#:nodoc:` applied to it.  What is the purpose of this evil `#:nodoc:`
  comment?\r\n\r\nHow do you tell where method come from?\r\n  \r\n    .ancestors.sort_by
  {|a| a.name}\r\n    .methods.sort\r\n\r\nCreate a rails plugin called schema_navigator?"
