title: Python is Weird
body: "I've heard some good things about the <a href=\"http://www.djangoproject.com/\">Django
  framework</a>.  One thing that as me interested in Django is that the way it works
  in general is you define your domain model in code, in Python objects, and Django
  figures out how to build a database for you.  Conceptually, I like this idea better
  than <a href=\"http://www.rubyonrails.org/\">Ruby on Rails</a>, where you define
  your domain model in the database, and then rails generates objects for you at runtime
  based on the database metadata.  Also, you run it my installing mod_python in apache.
  \ Again, compared to rails with apache, FCGI/SCGI, lighttpd, mongrel, etc..., I
  don't know, let's just say I have found the process of setting up a rails production
  web/app server challenging.  I haven't done it for Django yet, we'll see.  Should
  be a small memory footprint too, making it easy to run multiple apps in my 192MB
  virtual server webhost.\r\n\r\nBut one thing I want to comment on now is that I
  find Python to be weird.  Maybe this is because I have done most of my programming
  in Java, but when I started to learn Ruby, everything in Ruby just made sense, without
  Java's stupidity, such as NullPointerExceptions and primatives.  I've soured on
  rails recently, but I miss Ruby.  The language is succinct and powerful, it almost
  feels like writing psuedo code, except that it actually works.\r\n\r\nAnyway, let
  me just give a few examples of python weirdness.  But before I do, let me say this.
  \ I don't know python well at all.  Consider these statements to be my first impressions
  of Python.  I'm in no way stating that python is poor language due to these oddities,
  they just strike me as odd and I feel the need to express it.  So, on with the weirdness:\r\n\r\nSo
  to get started, I started reading the <a href=\"http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/install/\">Django
  install guide</a>.  I noticed I needed python 2.3 or higher.  Fair enough, so python
  2.5 is the latest, so I installed that.\r\n\r\nThe next requirement is for MySQLdb.
  \ It says it works with python 2.3-2.4, doesn't say anything about 2.5.  I decide
  to install python 2.4 to be safe.  So just deciding which version of python to use
  is a little bit of a struggle.\r\n\r\nSo now I have python 2.4 and MySQLdb.  I want
  to try and do something simple to verify it is working.  I find an example in the
  docs:\r\n\r\n<pre>import MySQLdb\r\ndb=MySQLdb.connect(passwd=\"moonpie\",db=\"thangs\")\r\n\r\nc=db.cursor()\r\nmax_price=5\r\nc.execute(\"\"\"SELECT
  spam, eggs, sausage FROM breakfast\r\n          WHERE price < %s\"\"\", (max_price,))</pre>\r\n\r\nWhat's
  with the 3 quotes?  Anyway, let's give it a try.  First, I add c:python24\bin to
  my path, fire up a command prompt, and enter \"python\" in hopes of getting an interactive
  shell.  Python isn't found.  Why not, because the python executables aren't in c:python24\bin,
  they are in c:python24.  Ok fine, I fix my path, but I decide to use the IDLE GUI
  instead. I try to enter a query, but I make a typo.  I press the up arrow, but it
  doesn't bring up my previous command.  I re-type it and get it right this time.
  \ The query is:\r\n\r\n<code>select count(*) from users</code>\r\n\r\nThis returns
  9 when I execute the query in mysql.  What does Python return?\r\n\r\n<code>1L</code>\r\n\r\n1L?
  \ What is that?  Again, I am naive when it comes to python, this is not a fair criticism
  of Python, I have done very little to learn the language at this point, I just trying
  to illustrate a point.  I know Java well.  When I started learning Ruby, from the
  start, everything just worked as you expected it would.  As I look into Python,
  I find one oddity after another.  I'm sure if you know Python well you will consider
  many of the things in Java odd, so I'm just going to consider all of these things
  first impressions and move on to learn more about the language and give it a fair
  chance.  But Python is still Weird.\r\n"
