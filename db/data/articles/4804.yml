title: Improving productivity instead of outsourcing
body: "I just got back from the [Northern Virgina Ruby Users Group meeting][novarug]
  meeting.  It was the first meeting I have been to.  I was expecting a dozen or so
  people to be there, I would say there was more like 60 people.  [Chad Fowler][fowler]
  was the speaker and he gave an excellent talk about writing quick and clean code
  with Rails.  Really, it was just a collection of examples of how to write clean
  code with Rails.  The main point of the talk is that Rails is built on Ruby and
  that with Ruby you can do a lot of powerful things.  You should master the Ruby
  language and then use the power of Ruby to the fullest to help you write better
  Rails code.\r\n\r\nAnother point he made is that \"Java is a language that was created
  for idiots\".  That is a funny and inflammatory statement, but what he means is
  that Java doesn't allow you to do stupid things like re-define what the + operator
  (or in the case of Ruby, method) does, because things like that are dangerous.  For
  example, say you create this Ruby code and put it somewhere in your app so that
  it executes before the rest of your code (like at the point your whole app is initialized,
  for example):\r\n\r\n    class Fixnum\r\n        def + arg\r\n            self*arg\r\n
  \       end\r\n    end\r\n\r\nSo then what happens when you run `1+2`?  You get
  2.  Why?  Because you have redefined the + method (that's right, the name of the
  method is \"+\") to now multiply the argument by self, rather than add it.  So that
  is stupid, and idiots do stupid things.  So Java doesn't let you do that, because
  it thinks you are an idiot and it's job is to protect you from doing stupid things.
  \ Ruby, on the other hand, assumes you are not an idiot and you will not do stupid
  things.  It allows you to do pretty much anything you want, because you probably
  have a good reason for doing so, because, after all, you're not an idiot.  He did
  go on to clarify that if you program in Java, that doesn't make you an idiot, just
  a programmer who uses a language built for idiots.\r\n\r\nThere were lots of other
  Ruby/Rails specific things that he points out, hopefully he'll put the slides online.
  \ But one last thing that I found interesting that came up in the discussion was
  that he thought Paul Graham once said \"Why would I hire offshore developers to
  write code when I could just hire someone to do it in Rails?\".  The point being
  that you can get more for your development money one of two ways:  Pay less per
  hour or pay someone to accomplish the task in less hours.  $100/hour x 10 hours
  = $10/hour + 100 hours, what's the difference.\r\n\r\nIt's an interesting point,
  and I really like Paul Graham's writing, so I did some googling to find the original
  article, which I think I found and it is titled [The Venture Capital Squeeze][graham].
  \ I think the actual quote that he is referring to is:\r\n\r\n> I think a better
  model for the future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development
  to a more powerful language instead. A lot of well-known applications are now, like
  BaseCamp, written by just one programmer. And one guy is more than 10x cheaper than
  ten, because (a) he won't waste any time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably
  a founder, he can pay himself nothing.\r\n\r\n[novarug]: http://novarug.org/articles/2007/01/24/february-meeting\r\n[fowler]:
