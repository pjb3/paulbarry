title: Don't ever give out your email username/password
body: "Here's [a tale of what can happen when you give 3rd party software of any kind
  the username and password to your email account][atwood].  I think it's absolutely
  ridiculous that \"real\" applications like Facebook encourage this kind of behavior.
  \ It trains people to believe that it's ok to give out your email username and password.
  \ Luckily Google has taken steps to make this unnecessary by [providing a secure
  way of getting your email contacts][contacts].  Hopefully this will catch on.\r\n\r\n[contacts]:
