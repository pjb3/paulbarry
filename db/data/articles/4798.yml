title: Prototype toggle gotcha
body: "I've been using the [Prototype JavaScript Library][prototype] lately, because
  it simplifies your JavaScript syntax and gives you a simple mechanism for AJAX requests.
  \ I ran into one gotcha, and I'm not sure if this is a bug, or if this is just the
  way things are.  I had the following code:\r\n\r\n    <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Element.toggle('foo');
  return false;\">Foo</a>\r\n    <p id=\"foo\" class=\"bar\">\r\n      ...\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\nIn
  an external stylesheet, I set the display for bar to none.  So, you would think
  that when the page loads, the p would not be visable and when you click on the link,
  it would become visable.  It didn't work.  I resorted to `document.getElementById('foo').style.display=''`
  for the onclick on the link, which also didn't work.  This is what makes me think
  it is a DOM thing and not something prototype can deal with.  I took the `display:
  none` out of the CSS for bar and then changed the HTML to this:\r\n\r\n    <a href=\"#\"
  onclick=\"Element.toggle('foo'); return false;\">Foo</a>\r\n    <p id=\"foo\" class=\"bar\"
  style=\"display: none\">\r\n      ...\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\nAnd now it works.  So I
  guess you can't use toggle where the CSS has set the element to `display:none` to
  start with.\r\n\r\n[prototype]: http://www.prototypejs.org/"
