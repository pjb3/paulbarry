title: Why do we give Apple a pass?
body: "I've been adding a few music podcasts to my iPod this morning, and I ran across
  a [website that appears to be producing a pretty good podcast][nugscast], but as
  far as I call tell they don't list their podcast in the iTunes directory.  That
  seems odd, you would think they would want people to subscribe to their podcast
  via iTunes, but they do have an RSS feed.  So I thought, ok, well maybe there's
  a way to subscribe to an RSS feed via iTunes, but there doesn't appear to be.  It
  makes sense too, because Apple wants you to go through the iTunes store to subscribe
  to a podcast, so they can get you to buy music in the process.  In order to maintain
  their monopoly, they'll never add that feature.  \r\n\r\nSo I'm trying out [YamiPod][yamipod]
  which appears to have that feature.  But it got me to thinking, just as the first
  poster points out in [a recent Slashdot article calling out Apple for unfairly bundling
  Safari with iTunes][slashdot], why do we let Apple get away with all sorts of monopolistic
  things that we would absolutely kill Microsoft for?  I think the obvious answer
  is that, in general, we like Apple and the software they make, but I think we've
  got to call them out on things like this. \r\n\r\n**Update:** Whoops, my bad :).
  \ If you go to Advanced > Subscribe to Podcast in iTunes, you can subscribe to any
  random URL that is a valid feed.\r\n\r\n[yamipod]: http://www.yamipod.com\r\n[nugscast]:
