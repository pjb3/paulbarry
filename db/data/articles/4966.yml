title: Zipping Arrays
body: "When programming in any language, you are sure to be in a situation at some
  point where you have two or more arrays that match up by index.  For example, say
  you have this:\r\n\r\n    cities = %w[Baltimore Washington Pittsburgh]\r\n    teams
  = %w[Ravens Redskins Steelers]\r\n\r\nSo the in this case, the name of the team
  in the nth city is the nth team.  In languages like Java and JavaScript, a common
  method for doing this would be to use a for loop and pull each value out of the
  array using the index:\r\n\r\n    for i in (0...cities.size)\r\n      puts \"%s
  %s\" % [cities[i], teams[i]]\r\n    end\r\n\r\nAs you can see, this works in Ruby
  as well.  The output of that will be:\r\n      \r\n    Baltimore Ravens\r\n    Washington
  Redskins\r\n    Pittsburgh Steelers\r\n\r\nBut Ruby's enumerable class has a built-in
  method for handling this that you might not know about.  On any Enumerable, you
  can call zip and pass in another array and it will return a two-dimensional array
  with each of the values paired up:\r\n\r\n    p cities.zip(teams) \r\n    # => [[\"Baltimore\",
  \"Ravens\"], [\"Washington\", \"Redskins\"], [\"Pittsburgh\", \"Steelers\"]]\r\n\r\nConveniently,
  Ruby's each method also allows you to assign each value of the sub-array to a variable
  in the block.  So we can perform the for loop from above like this:\r\n\r\n    cities.zip(teams).each
  do |city, team|\r\n      puts \"%s %s\" % [city, team]\r\n    end\r\n\r\nWhich outputs:\r\n\r\n
  \   Baltimore Ravens\r\n    Washington Redskins\r\n    Pittsburgh Steelers\r\n\r\nNo
  indexes to keep track of.  Also, the zip method can take multiple arrays, so you
  can zip up more than one array and iterate through them in a similar fashion:\r\n\r\n
  \   qbs = %w[Flacco McNabb Roethlisberger]\r\n    \r\n    cities.zip(teams, qbs).each
  do |city, team, qb|\r\n      puts \"%s %s %s\" % [city, team, qb]\r\n    end\r\n
  \   \r\nWhich outputs:\r\n    \r\n    Baltimore Ravens Flacco\r\n    Washington
  Redskins McNabb\r\n    Pittsburgh Steelers Roethlisberger\r\n"
