title: Editing Files in Place with Ruby
body: "One thing that's interesting about Ruby is that you can blatantly see the influence
  of other languages such as Lisp, Smalltalk, Perl and Java in it.  One thing I always
  used to use Perl for is a simple search and replace tool:\r\n\r\n    perl -pi -e
  's/foo/bar/g' *.txt\r\n\r\nI recently discovered that there is a similar equivalent
  with Ruby: \r\n\r\n    ruby -pi -e \"gsub(/foo/, 'bar')\" *.txt\r\n\r\n"
