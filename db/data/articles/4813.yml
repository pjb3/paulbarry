title: AJAX with Prototype
body: "I just got back from the [B'More on Rails][bmore] meeting in which Chris Strom
  gave a presentation on [AJAX with Protoype][bor].  It was a great presentation,
  job well done Chris.  I thought I would point out a few things that I learned.\r\n\r\nFirst
  of all, prototype has a [$$ method][$$] that I didn't know about.  It allows you
  to select multiple elements using a CSS selector and then do stuff to them using
  an iterator.  For example, if you are playing along at home and you have [Firebug][fb]
  installed, open the [Firebug console][fb-cl] on this page and enter this javascript:\r\n\r\n
  \   $$('a').each(function(a){a.hide()})\r\n\r\nHey, where did all the links go?
  \ You can probably figure out how to make them re-appear.  The cool thing about
  this is that the value you pass to the `$$` method is a CSS selector.  So for example,
  want to make all those tags in the sidebar go away?\r\n\r\n    $$('.sidebar-node
  p span').each(function(s){s.hide()})\r\n\r\nAnother interesting thing I learned
  is that [using DOM to create content in a page is a lot slower than innerHTML][qm].
  \ For that reason, you will see a lot of JavaScript that creates new content on
  a page written like this:\r\n\r\n    var html = [\r\n      \"<div>\",\r\n      \"<p>Hello
  There, I'm a new paragraph</p>\",\r\n      \"</div>\"\r\n    ]\r\n    $('some-div').innerHTML
  += html.join(\"\");\r\n\r\nBecause it is faster.\r\n\r\n[bmore]: http://www.bmoreonrails.org/\r\n[bor]:
