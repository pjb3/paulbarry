title: It's the little things
body: "When programming in Ruby, not a day goes by that I don't have one of those
  I Love Ruby moments.  You know, when you are trying to do something, and you are
  wondering if it work the way you want, and then you fire up IRB to try it out, and
  it does work like you expected.  Nothing earth shattering like monads or macros,
  just little things, like this:\r\n    \r\n    >> [['a', 1],['b', 2]].each_with_index{|(x,y),i|
  puts \"#{i}: #{x} => #{y}\"}\r\n    0: a => 1\r\n    1: b => 2\r\n\r\nThey add up
  :)\r\n\r\n"
