title: The Importance of a Common Development Philosophy for a Team
body: "I try to stay out of language wars, because they just aren't productive.  One
  thing I have found interesting is that a year ago or so, it seemed to be the Ruby
  guys picking fights with the Java guys saying \"Ruby is better than Java, Rails
  is better than J2EE\".  Lately, it's [Java guys saying][king] \"Java is better than
  Ruby, JEE/Seam/Struts 2.0/RIFE/Wicket/Some yet to be invented Java framework is
  better than Rails\".  I get the sense that most Rails guys have just moved on from
  arguing with Java guys about this, although [some still have a hard time resisting
  the temptation][obie].  It's a hard temptation to resist, because I hate to see
  people say things about Ruby that I disagree with, and I'd hate to see more people
  believing the anti-dynamic languages, anti-Ruby FUD.  Maybe FUD is a little harsh,
  but I'm sure other people consider my support of Ruby to be FUD.\r\n\r\nI really
  liked [Dion Almaer's response][almaer] to another \"[Java is better than Ruby][beust]\"
  post:\r\n\r\n> Quite frankly, at this stage of the game all I care about is having
  a small team of developers that I respect and enjoy working with.\r\n\r\nThat's
  where I'm at too.  It's more important to be on a team with developers that you
  respect.  But it's more than respect really, it's more like sharing a common development
  philosophy.  I can envision a scenario where there is a Java developer that I respect,
  but that same developer just hates Ruby.  In that case, we're not likely to be on
  the same page in terms of the way we think a certain solution should be architected,
  and that being the case, it's not likely to be a productive situation for either
  of us.  I think for anyone involved in a position of hiring developers, this is
  a key factor to try to be able to evaluate.  First, what is the philosophy of my
  development team, and then when interviewing candidates, will this developer fit
  in with the team well.  I'm sure there are a lot of factors that contribute to this,
  but here's a few I can think of:\r\n\r\n - What is your preferred development platform?\r\n
  - What is your preferred method of unit testing?\r\n - What are some of your favorite
  features of language x?\r\n - What are some of your favorite features of framework
  x?\r\n - Which database platforms have you worked with, and which do you prefer?\r\n\r\nI
  think anytime you can put together a team of good developers who are on the same
  page with most of these answers, that team is going to be productive.\r\n\r\n\r\n[king]:
