title: MP3 players that play songs in order
body: "<div style=\"float:right\" class=\"imgcap-right\"><img src=\"http://www.paulbarry.com/images/samsung-yp-u2jzw.jpg\"/><br/>Don't
  Buy This</div>I just recently purchased a <a href=\"http://samsung.com/Products/MP3Player/MP3Player/YP_U2JZWXAA.asp\">Samsung
  YP-UJZW MP3 player</a> from <a href=\"http://www.newegg.com\">New Egg</a>, and discovered
  to my horror that it would not play the songs in order by track number, only alhpabetically
  order.  Even when you use the little menu to navigate to an album, the tracks are
  listed in alphabetical order.  This seems pretty ridiculous to me, so I'm in the
  process of returning it to New Egg.  I would have assumed this would be a \"feature\"
  any MP3 player would have.\r\n\r\nSo now I'm considering one of the <a href=\"http://www.creative.com/products/welcome.asp?category=213\">Creative
  MP3 Players</a>, but I'm trying to <a href=\"http://forums.creative.com/creativelabs/board/message?board.id=dap&message.id=156366\">find
  out</a> if the Creative MP3 players do play the albums in order.  Moral of the story,
  don't buy an MP3 player from Samsung.\r\n\r\n"
