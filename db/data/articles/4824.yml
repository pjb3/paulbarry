title: I, For One, Welcome Our New Satellite Overloards
body: "[XM and Sirius are trying to merge][nyt], but running into anticompetitive
  claims.  Personally, I don't drive that much, and when I do I listen to music on
  an iPod or MP3 CD.  I rarely listen to the radio, unless I'm trying to pick up local
  coverage of a baseball or football game while on a long trip.  If I could get satellite
  radio for $10 a month that would give me every NFL, every MLB game, and [Jam On][jamon],
  I would be sold.  Until then, I will stick to their competitors, the iPod and FM
  radio.\r\n\r\n[nyt]: http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/15/business/15interview.html?ex=1347508800&en=d04ae380b5f78b42&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss\r\n[jamon]:
