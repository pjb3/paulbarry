title: Node.js talk at Baltimore/JavaScript Users Group
body: "Just a quick heads up that I'll be talking about [Node.js][node] at [this Wednesday's
  Baltimore/JavaScript Users Group][talk] meeting.  This will be an introductory talk
  but will quickly dive into some code examples with Q & A.  The talk, just as node.js
  itself, centers around using Evented, Asynchronous I/O to get better scalability
  out of network servers, so it should be of interest to anyone doing server-side
  programming in any language, Java, Perl, Ruby, Python, etc.  See you there!\r\n\r\n[node]:
