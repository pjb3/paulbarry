title: Behold, the Intel Mac Mini
body: As <a href="http://www.paulbarry.com/articles/2006/02/13/the-intel-mac-mini">predicted</a>,
  the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Intel Mac Mini</a> is out, checking
  in at $599 for the solo and $799 fro the duo.  $1,224 will get you a duo core with
  2GB of RAM and 120GB disk.  Looks cool, but it's just too pricey.  I thought Intel
  chips were going to make Mac cheaper?  Guess not...
