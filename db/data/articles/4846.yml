title: LISP - My Personal NBL
body: "Practical Common Ruby\r\n\r\nIn the not to distant past I considered myself
  a \"Java\" programmer.  For my job, I programmed in Java, although I knew and used
  some other languages to varying degrees, including Perl, PHP, Python and JavaScript.
  \ I started to learn Ruby due to all the hype Rails was getting.  I really liked
  Ruby and now program in Ruby almost exclusively, so I suppose I can drop the \"Java\"
  from my informal title.  I don't think I'll ever call myself a \"Ruby\" programmer
  because one of the many things I have learned while learning Ruby is that learning
  different languages makes you a better programmer in general.  You learn new techniques
  that you can apply to programming in almost any language.\r\n\r\nSo throughout my
  career I expect to continue learn other languages.  A few that are on my horizon
  for now are Smalltalk, C/C++, Haskell, Erlang and maybe dive a bit deeper into Python,
  but for now those are all on the back burner.  A few years ago I was programming
  in Java in my day job and learning Ruby in my spare time.  Now I'm programming in
  Ruby in my day job and learning Lisp in my spare time.\r\n\r\nThere are several
  reason for wanting to learn Lisp, but I would say Paul Graham is definitely at the
  top of that list.  I read his book [Hackers and Painters][hp] and I suggest you
  do as well.  The book is actually a collection of essays, most of which you can
  read online:\r\n\r\n1. [Why Nerds Are Unpopular][hp1]\r\n2. [Hackers and Painter][hp2]\r\n3.
  [What You Can't Say][hp3]\r\n4. Good Bad Attitude\r\n5. [The Other Road Ahead][hp5]\r\n6.
  [How to Make Wealth][hp6]\r\n7. [Mind the Gap][hp7]\r\n8. [A Plan for Spam][hp8]\r\n9.
  [Taste for Makers][hp9]\r\n10. Programming Languages Explained\r\n11. [The Hundred-Year
  Language][hp11]\r\n12. [Beating the Averages][hp12]\r\n13. [Revenge of the Nerds][hp13]\r\n14.
  The Dream Language\r\n15. [Design and Research][hp15]\r\n\r\nIt looks like there
  are some good free online resources for learning Lisp.  I'm gonna start with [Practical
  Common Lisp][pcl], and I've also been going through Structure and Interpretation
  of Computer Programs.  It is a computer programming course that is available online.
