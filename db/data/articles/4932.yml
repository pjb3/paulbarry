title: 'Message to Apple: Get Your Act Together'
body: "This will be a short post, because [Jonathan Zdziarski has said it much better
  than I could][amber], but the bottom line is that Apple needs to get their act together
  with the App Store.  Coming of this heels of the [NDA debacle][nda], this is just
  ridiculous.  Take the time to read [Johathan's email to Apple][amber-email] and
  you'll see what I mean.\r\n\r\n[nda]: http://www.touchpodium.com/2008/08/09/iphone-programmers-upset-about-apples-nda/\r\n[amber]:
