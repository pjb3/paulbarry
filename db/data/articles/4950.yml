title: Why Rails 3 Will Require Ruby 1.8.7
body: "This past weekend I attended the [Windy City Rails][wcr] conference.  It was
  in a great location in the heart of downtown Chicago and seemed to have a pretty
  good turn out.  There were many great talks but this blog post will be focusing
  on a specific talk, and more precisely, part of a talk.  [Yehuda Katz][katz] gave
  a talk on the status of Rails 3.  One of the things that he mentioned, which you
  may have already heard, is that Rails 3 will require Ruby 1.8.7 or higher, dropping
  support for Ruby 1.8.6.  He also mentioned why they are doing this and I found the
  reason to be interesting.  It's not that the Rails core team wants to try to take
  advantage of any specific new features, it's that Ruby 1.8.6 has a bug which has
  been fixed in 1.8.7.\r\n\r\nTo see the bug in action, I recommend that you install
  [Ruby Version Manager (rvm)][rvm].  Once you have installed rvm, install Ruby 1.8.6
  and Ruby 1.8.7.  \r\n\r\nThe bug is that in Ruby 1.8.6, the `hash` method for `Hash`
  doesn't generate the same hash code for different hashes with the same values:\r\n\r\n
  \   $ rvm use 1.8.6\r\n    $ irb\r\n    ruby-1.8.6-p383 > {:x => 1}.hash\r\n     =>
  1313270 \r\n    ruby-1.8.6-p383 > {:x => 1}.hash\r\n     => 1307060 \r\n    ruby-1.8.6-p383
  > {:x => 1}.hash\r\n     => 1296440 \r\n    ruby-1.8.6-p383 > {:x => 1} == {:x =>
  1}\r\n     => true\r\n    ruby-1.8.6-p383 > h = {{:x => 1} => \"foo\"}\r\n     =>
  {{:x=>1}=>\"foo\"} \r\n    ruby-1.8.6-p383 > h[{:x => 1}]\r\n     => nil\r\n     \r\nSo
  despite the fact that two hashes have the same values and are equal, you can't use
  a hash as a key in a hash, because that depends on the hash codes of the values
  being equal, which they aren't.  This is fixed in Ruby 1.8.7:\r\n\r\n    $ rvm use
  1.8.7\r\n    $ irb\r\n    ruby-1.8.7-p174 > {:x => 1}.hash\r\n     => 327875 \r\n
  \   ruby-1.8.7-p174 > {:x => 1}.hash\r\n     => 327875 \r\n    ruby-1.8.7-p174 >
  {:x => 1}.hash\r\n     => 327875 \r\n    ruby-1.8.7-p174 > {:x => 1} == {:x => 1}\r\n
  \    => true \r\n    ruby-1.8.7-p174 > h = {{:x => 1} => \"foo\"}\r\n     => {{:x=>1}=>\"foo\"}
  \r\n    ruby-1.8.7-p174 > h[{:x => 1}]\r\n     => \"foo\" \r\n\r\nThis is important
  because you could use a hash cache calls to a method that expects a hash, but only
  if you can use a hash as the key.  This is one of the main reasons Rails 3 is going
  to require 1.8.7.  They could make it worth for both 1.8.6 and 1.8.7 and higher,
  but why?  It simplifies things to just require that you upgrade to Ruby 1.8.7 to
  use Rails 3.  If you are using 1.8.6, this is probably a gotcha that you should
  be aware of.\r\n\r\n\r\n[katz]: http://yehudakatz.com\r\n[wcr]: http://windycityrails.org\r\n[rvm]:
