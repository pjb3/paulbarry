title: The Intel Mac Mini
body: I've been wanting to get a Mac for years now, and I think it may happen soon.  I've
  wanted to buy a mac, but they are just so over-priced.  I look at the G5 and think
  it looks sweet, but then I think to myself that I could build an Intel-based system
  for a quarter of the price.  I'm hoping the switch over to Intel will keep the cost
  down, but we'll see.  <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/pages/2006/02/20060213172553.shtml">Rumor
  has it</a> that there will be an Intel-based Mac Mini out within the next few months.  "Specs
  are expected to be 1.67GHz Intel Core Solo processor, 512MB RAM, and Front Row."  If
  they can do that with a decently  fast hard drive for $499, I'm sold.
