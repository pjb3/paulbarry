title: Ruby is just for generating web pages
body: "In a recent Java talk, <a href=\"http://java.sys-con.com/read/193146_trackback.htm\">James
  Gosling said:</a> \"PHP and Ruby are perfectly fine systems,\" he continued, \"but
  they are scripting languages and get their power through specialization: they just
  generate web pages.\"\r\n\r\nI find this to be an interesting statement on many
  levels.  First of all, it is yet another example of the fact that Ruby and Rails
  simply scares the crap of Java developers, for some unexplicable reason.  <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/say.html\">As
  Paul Graham points out</a>, whenever you say something that seems to attract a lot
  of negative criticism, you might be on to a revolutionary idea.  There are <a href=\"http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=39066\">many
  examples</a> where even the mere suggestion that Ruby on Rails might be a more productive
  framework than Java/J2EE sparks a heated debate.\r\n\r\nSecondly, James Gosling
  tries to trivialize web-based applications.  Do you know how many Java/J2EE applications
  there are that \"just generate web pages\"?  If Gosling is implying that Ruby generates
  web pages better than Java, I guess that means we can all stop using Tomcat/Resin/Jetty,
  Struts/Spring/WebWork and Hibernate, because Ruby, as a scripting language, is taking
  care of that \"specialization\".\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, I think the use of the word
  scripting is very cafeully placed.  Although I do admit that I'm not convinced Ruby
  can scale yet (but that is simply due to the fact that I haven't had an opportunity
  to research that claim myself, I have no opinion one way or the other yet), Gosling
  seems to be implying that scripted languages are somehow inferior by nature.  But
  isn't Java really an interpreted language too?  The JVM interprets the bytecode
  at runtime and executes it.  Why is this inherently better than running a Ruby interpreter?\r\n\r\nI
  would say that on the spectrum of Ruby Vs. Java, with James Gosling and all other
  Ruby haters on one end and Bruce Tate and all the other \"Java is dead, long live
  Ruby\"-ist on the other end, I am somewhere in the middle.  I'm going to continue
  to research Ruby and Rails and see if there are situations where it makes more sense
  to use one or the other.  One thing I can say is that learning Ruby on Rails has
  made me a better Java programmer.  There are techniques used in Ruby and Rails that
  can be applied to Java and J2EE, which can make you more productive.\r\n\r\nI found
  the same thing can happen with music.  I took Guitar lessons in college, learner
  to play some scales and chords, read music, etc.  I messed around on the Guitar
  occasions for a few years afterwards, not really getting any better.  Then I started
  taking Piano lessons.  I found after a while that when I picked up the Guitar again,
  I was a better Guitar player.  Since Piano and Guitar are both instruments that
  play music, learning music from the aspect of another instrument made be a better
  musician, therefore a better guitar player.\r\n\r\nThe same can be said for Ruby
  and Rails.  Java/J2EE and Ruby on Rails are both programming languages and frameworks
  for building web applications.  Programming, specifically web application programming,
  is about processing HTTP requests, querying databases, parsing XML, etc.  Learning
  another programming language and framework will only make you a better programmer,
  and therefore a better Java programmer."
