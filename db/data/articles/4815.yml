title: Is your language beautiful?
body: "There is a good presentation posted over on infoq.com by Glenn Vanderburg called
  [The Beauty of Ruby][vanderburg].  First of all, I like the format of the presentation
  on that site.  You get the video of the speaker, but you can still see the slides
  below it.\r\n\r\nI agree with all of his points about Ruby, which are all reasons
  why I've been doing all of my programming lately in Ruby.  There's a point he makes
  early on in the presentation that I think is probably very accurate.  Most people
  who really give Ruby a try on a real project with an open mind will find that they
  love it.  The key is that you must unlearn what you have learned.  Some things that
  would be considered a bad idea in other languages turn out to be not a problem in
  Ruby, for one reason or another.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, Glenn is careful to
  focus more on what he likes about Ruby, and less what he doesn't like about other
  languages.  But as is inevitable when discussing a language, there are comparisons
  to other languages.  Perl gets the most criticisms, and Java some as well, but very
  little criticism of Python.  Lisp and Smalltalk, as usual, get some love but some
  criticisms as well.  So I'm wondering, is your language beautiful?  What parts of
  your language do you consider to be beautiful, specifically when compared to Ruby?
