title: MacBookPro.new
body: "I just got a new Macbook Pro and I'm slightly underwhelmed so far.  It didn't
  have Leopard installed, it has Tiger.  Ok, not a big deal, but it is a slight annoyance,
  considering Leopard has been out for over a month.  It did come with the Leopard
  DVD, so no problem, I'll just install that.  So I pop in the DVD, reboot, and we're
  back to the Welcome to Mac OS X 10.4 screen.  :(\r\n\r\nLuckily I stumbled across
  [this article][macfixit] the says hold down \"C\" while it is booting to get it
  to boot from DVD.  Or maybe the command key.  Oh, and if that doesn't work, then
  try Command+Option+Shift+Delete.  Huh?  I know that white screen that comes up with
  the grey apple is pretty and everything, but do you think they could have it detect
  if you have a DVD in the drive, and if so, have it say \"Press the Apple Key to
  boot from DVD\"?  It's always the little things.  Anyway, let's see if I can have
  [Rails][rails] running by the end of the night.\r\n\r\n[macfixit]: http://www.macfixit.com/article.php?story=20050311073316780\r\n[rails]:
