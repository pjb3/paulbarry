  weeks ago I received my printed copy of [Programming Clojure][pc] by [Stuart Halloway][stu]
  in the mail.  I had been a technical reviewer of the book so I was excited to see
  it finally in print.  In case you haven't heard of it yet, [Clojure][clj] is a programming
  language designed by Rich Hickey, a Lisp dialect, that runs on the Java Virtual
  Machine and is designed support concurrent programming.\r\n\r\nClojure has [excellent
  documentation][clj-doc] and Rich has posted [several great videos][clj-vids] of
  talks he has given that cover the rational for Clojure as well as an introduction
  into the major concepts.  I highly recommend that you watch those videos if you
  haven't already because Rich does a great job explaining why concurrency is hard
  using the typical Object-Oriented model that we program in today and how the features
  of Clojure support a better model for concurrency.  Whether you are programming
  in Java, C#, Erlang, Haskell, Python, Ruby, etc., you will probably be able to learn
  something from these talks, and plus Rich is just an interesting guy to listen to.\r\n\r\nSo
  after all that, you might be saying why do we need a book about Clojure?  The answer
  is that although the documentation is good, it can be a little intimidating when
  first learning Clojure.  For programmers with little or no Lisp or functional programming
  experience, figuring out how to do basic things the idiomatic way in Clojure can
  be a daunting task.  Stuart's book does an excellent job filling this gap.\r\n\r\nThe
  book covers all the major feature of Clojure and is very up-to-date.  As a reviewer
  I got to see the evolution of this book from revision to revision and it was amazing
  to me to see how much work Stuart put in.  Chapters were often completely re-written
  to keep up with changes in the language that occurred before it stabilized in a
  1.0 release.  I think the final product greatly benefited from that work and is
  an excellent resource for learning Clojure.  I encourage you to pick up a copy today.\r\n\r\n[pc]:
