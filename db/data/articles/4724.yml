title: Grails is not a Rails clone
body: "I just read [Graeme's post][rocher] post about JavaPolis 2006, and in it one
  thing he mentions is that Grails \"is not just a Rails clone\".  For what I have
  read about it so far, I agree with that statement.  I would go as far as to say
  that Grails was probably a poor choice of name, because I think there a lot of Java
  developers out there that took a look at rails, didn't like it, and then when they
  hear Grails, they think \"A rails clone in Groovy/Java, why would I be interested
  in that?\".\r\n\r\nGrails has a lot of features and architectural difference from
  Rails that make it (I won't say better, so as to avoid a flame war) more attractive
  to Java developers.  But I will say that I've ran into a few problems already just
  trying to get a few simple examples working, not the least of which is subscribing
  to the Grails mailing list.  Rather than post them here, I'll try to get my mailing
  list issues worked out and get help over there.\r\n\r\n[rocher]: http://graemerocher.blogspot.com/2006/12/grails-javapolis-report.html"
