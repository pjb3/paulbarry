title: Simple Tweet Interface
body: "Here's a request for a feature for [Twitter][twitter].  Hopefully they already
  have this and someone will leave a comment explaining how you do it.  Say you have
  a website, like a blog for example, and you want to make it dead simple 1-click
  easy to tweet that you've just created something cool and you want to share with
  the world.  Say the url for it is [http://paulbarry.com/foo][rickroll].  What I
  want is to be able to have a link like:\r\n\r\n    <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?tweet=http%3A%2F%2Fpaulbarry.com%2Ffoo\">Tweet
  This!</a>\r\n\r\nAnd have that take me to the twitter home page.  Assuming I'm logged
  into twitter, twitter would be smart enough to take the contents of that `tweet`
  querystring parameter and pre-populate the \"What are your doing?\" box with that.
  \ Then I would just click the update button and it would be tweeted.  I guess you
  could call it a tweet-through link.\r\n\r\nSure, for a blog, I can just copy and
  paste the URL into that text box, but I'm thinking more of a site that would have
  lots of users and you would want to make it easy form them to just click on a link
  and have the tweet all setup for them, so they would just have to press update.
  \ This would elimate the need for the user to give me their twitter username/password,
  which as far as I can tell would be required in order to accomplish this kind of
  thing, but I think [asking an end user for their username/password to a 3rd party
  site is ridiculous][passwd].\r\n\r\n[twitter]: http://twitter.com\r\n[rickroll]:
