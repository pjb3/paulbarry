title: The Web Application Framework Candidates
body: "The web application framework race is heating up, so let's take a moment to
  meet some of the candidates.\r\n\r\n### Java ###\r\n![George W. Bush](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/George-W-Bush.jpeg/453px-George-W-Bush.jpeg
  \"George W. Bush\")\r\n\r\nThe current leader in the web application framework space,
  has a declining approval rating from the general public, but still maintains support
  from members of the static typing party.\r\n\r\n### Rails ###\r\n![Hillary Clinton](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton.jpg/480px-Hillary_Rodham_Clinton.jpg
  \"Hillary Clinton\")\r\n\r\nOne of the leading candidates from the dynamic typing
  party.  This candidate has experience that proves she can bring change.\r\n\r\n###
  Merb ###\r\n![Barack Obama](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/ObamaBarack.jpg
  \"Barack Obama\")\r\n\r\nA candidate from the dynamic party who is quickly gaining
  support, running on his campaign of hope.  Has a stance similar to that of Rails
  on many of the campaign issues.\r\n\r\n### Django ###\r\n![John Edwards](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/John_Edwards%2C_official_Senate_photo_portrait.jpg/468px-John_Edwards%2C_official_Senate_photo_portrait.jpg
  \"John Edwards\")\r\n\r\nAnother strong dynamic party candidate, but having a hard
  time stealing the spotlight from the two dynamic party candidates, despite running
  on a strong platform.\r\n\r\n### Grails ###\r\n![John McCain](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/John_McCain_official_photo_portrait.JPG/473px-John_McCain_official_photo_portrait.JPG
  \"John McCain\")\r\n\r\nThe leading candidate for the static typing party, particularly
  among moderate static typers, but having a hard time gaining support from conservative
  members of the static party who claim that he is too dynamic on some issues.\r\n\r\n###
  Scala ###\r\n![Ron Paul](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Ron_Paul%2C_official_109th_Congress_photo.jpg
  \"Ron Paul\")\r\n\r\nA candidate that appeals to some members of both the dynamic
  and static typing parties, quickly gaining notoriety on the web for his support
  of once unconventional ideas like functional programming.\r\n"
