title: Bonnaroo 2007
body: "The artist lineup for Bonnaroo 2007 was [leaked][proboards21].  As I said [last
  year][paulbarry], Bonnaroo is a completely different festival then what it started
  out as.  Tool?  Are you serious.  I won't even get started on that, but the funny
  thing is how this guy got access to the information early.  Apparently he was doing
  some sniffing around on different urls and whammy:\r\n\r\n>Last night when the bonnaroo
  website started acting up I knew they must be in the process of updating the website
  for the artist announcement, so I tried a few different URLs to see if anything
  worked . . . when I typed in www.bonnaroo.com/artists, a clearly unfinished website
  came up. I've been checking it every hour waiting for an update and about twenty
  minutes ago it came . . .\r\n\r\n>http://www.bonnaroo.com/festivals/2007;lineup
  \ \r\n\r\nThe funny thing is that you can right away that it's a rails site, because
  that semi-colon in the URL is a dead give away of a RESTful URL.  For further evidence,
  the page the above URL redirects to is:\r\n\r\n    http://www.bonnaroo.com/sessions/new\r\n\r\nAgain,
  a very rails looking URL.  If you look at the source of that page, you see the `?1171436393`
  appended to the JS and CSS files, another railism.  So I guess the moral of the
  story is that you can use the best framework in the world, but if you don't know
  how to deploy it right, you can have \"security\" issues.  I use that term lightly
  because it's not like they put people DOBs and SSNs online, but it's still clearly
  information that they didn't want to have publicly available yet.\r\n\r\n[proboards21]:
