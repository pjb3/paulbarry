title: Struts is still on top
body: "According to poll conducted by JBoss, Struts is still the number one web framework,
  and by a convincing margin at 59%.  Second place is Java Server Faces at 35% and
  Spring MVC is at 26%.  I'm surprised to see WebWork so low down at 5%.  There seems
  to be a lot of discussion about WebWork, I would have thought it would be higher
  than Spring MVC.  I thought no one uses Spring MVC.  And I am also surprised to
  see Struts so high.  I would have thought most people would have moved on from Struts
  by now.\r\n\r\nMy personal experience with MVC frameworks is pretty simple.  I first
  start to learn the MVC pattern with Struts, which I think many other people did
  because it was the first mature MVC product to gain significant mindshare.  Struts
  had some limitations, but was certainly better than building your own web framework.
  \ I developed a couple of apps using Struts, happily creating ActionForms and using
  a mix of the struts tags and JSTL (it was in 1.1 in those days) in my views.\r\n\r\nThen
  I discovered Spring, which was more appealing simply from the standpoint that it
  addresses the whole stack of your application, not just the web part.  When I first
  started using Spring, I stuck with Struts for the web framework, partially because
  the Spring MVC framework seemed confusing at first.  But the more I studied the
  Spring MVC framework, I started to like the Data Binder and the way it treats GET
  versus POST requests.  Also, the ability to easily plug in a different view layer
  technology, such as velocity, which seemed infinately cleaner than JSP to me, made
  me switch to Spring MVC.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I haven't felt compelled to actually
  bother evaluating any of the other frameworks.  Spring seems at least \"good enough\"
  at this point.  WebWork, JSF, Tapestry, Wicket, maybe some of these frameworks have
  features that make them better.  But it takes time to get up to speed on new frameworks,
  and it doesn't seem like it would be worth the time for me to invest in it at this
  point.  \r\n\r\nAnd maybe that's exactly why Struts is still on top.  If you don't
  take the time to really evaluate what else is out there, you'll always think what
  you are using is good enough.  Well my personal experience has been that Spring
  MVC has made me a more productive developer.  So if you haven't do so yet, check
  out another framework, because it can make you a better developer too.  And I'll
  make a pledge to myself to check out a few of the other web frameworks as well."
