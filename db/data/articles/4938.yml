body: "Thanks to everyone who attended my talk yesterday at [Ruby Nation][rn] about
  [BrowserCMS][cms].  I've posted my slides online [here][slides].  Unfortunately
  the demo part of the talk wasn't record, so I'll try to record a screencast of the
  demo.  Look for that in the next few days.\r\n\r\nIf you did attend my talk, I would
  appreciate it if you take a minute to [rate it][sr].\r\n\r\n[rn]: http://rubynation.org\r\n[cms]:
