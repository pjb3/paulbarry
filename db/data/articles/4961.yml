title: Sharing a git repo on the network
body: "If you find yourself on a network with other developers you'd like to share
  a git repo with, here's a simple way to do that.  First, on your machine, the one
  with the git repo, you run this:\r\n\r\n    $ git daemon --base-path=/path/to/dir/with/repo
  --export-all\r\n\r\nSo if you have a git repo in your home directory called, foo,
  you would make the base path be your home directory.  Then, assuming your IP is
  192.168.1.42, others can clone the repo using:\r\n\r\n    $ git clone git://192.168.1.42/foo"
