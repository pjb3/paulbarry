title: ExtJS On Rails
body: "If you are looking to give [ExtJS][extjs] a spin, I've created a [Rails Application
  Template][ror-tmp] to setup a [Rails][ror] app with ExtJS installed.  To use it,
  just do:\r\n\r\n    rails -m http://tinyurl.com/extjs-rb my-extjs-app\r\n\r\nTo
  see a sample of this in use, take a look at this [Rails app][app].  It is a port
  of Chapter 1 of [ExtJS In Action][garcia] to Rails.  Assuming you have Rails 2.3.2
  installed, you should be able to download the Rails app from that git repo, run
  `script/server` and then try out the app at http://localhost:3000.\r\n\r\n__UPDATE:__
  This code actually refers to the code in the sample chapter on the [Manning website][garcia].
  \ Chapter 1 in the latest version of the book has actually been completely re-written,
  so I've included the [sample chapter in the git repo][sample].  Also be sure to
  check out the author's blog which covers the development of the book.\r\n\r\n[garcia]:
