title: Spam!
body: "So I'm pretty much done with Yahoo!  I used to use Yahoo! for my email, but
  I switched over to gmail years ago.  I occasionally have a friend say \"did you
  see that email from so and so\", because they saw that I was CC'd on the email,
  but it was my Yahoo! account, which I never check, so then I go in and check it.
  \ So I just logged in to my Yahoo! Mail account, 1074 messages in my Inbox, almost
  all of which are blatent spam which didn't get filtered into my Bulk folder.  I
  don't know about you, but I think it's pretty obvious a messsage with subject \"&#218;&#175;&#216;&#177;&#217;^&#217;&#216;&#167;&#219;&#217;&#216;&#170;&#216;&#177;&#217;&#216;&#170;&#219;&#216;&#167;&#219;&#216;&#177;&#216;&#167;&#217;&#219;&#216;&#167;&#217;\"
  is spam.  Ever since I switched to Gmail, I've had maybe a handful of actual spam
  end up in my Inbox, with only one non-spam message automated forgot password request
  (DirecTV, I'm looking at you) ending up in my Gmail Spam folder.  I don't know for
  sure, there could be more in there, because I never check or look at my Gmail Spam
  folder, but I've never had problems with emails going missing.\r\n\r\nThis spam
  problem seems to be system-wide with Yahoo!  Up until yesterday, I was using Adium
  for IM and logging into my AIM, GTalk, MSN and Yahoo! accounts.  I decided that
  I like iChat better and I'm just going to be opinionated about it and if you want
  to IM with me, you are going to have to use AIM.  But while logged in Yahoo!, I
  would notice I would receive anywhere from 1 to a dozen SPIMs (Spam Instant Messages)
  a day.  I've never received even 1 SPIM on any of the other IM networks.\r\n\r\nSo
  Yahoo!, it's over, you've lost to Google, let Microsoft buy you out, and as soon
  as Google buys Apple, we'll have ourselves a lifetime of Coke vs. Pepsi when it
  comes to software providers.  But this should be a lesson that the little things
  can kill you.  Spam is just one of those things that you have to get right in order
  for users to use your service.  I'm seeing the same thing repeating itself as I
  look as the MySpace friend requests from Mackenzie and Skyla, whereas I have none
  from Facebook.  Well, none from Mackenzie or Skyla at least, I do have _some_ friends
