title: RSS Feed for Comments
body: "Now that I have my blog developed in a framework that I can easily write code
  for, I'm able to add features pretty easily.  I have not yet implemented any spam
  protection for the comments, so I've had a few spam comments trickling in.  Also,
  I have had a few comments on my last entry, and I realized that I have no way of
  knowing when there are new comments on by blog.  I could subscribe to the feed for
  each article I created, but that seems like sort of a pain.  So what I decided to
  do was create [a feed for all of my comments][feed].  This is great because now
  I can just subscribe to this feed in my google reader, and I'll know pretty much
  right away when I have new comments to take a look at.  I'm not sure if typo, wordpress
  or other blogging software has this feature, but it's definitely nice to have. \r\n\r\n[feed]:
