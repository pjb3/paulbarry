  I write import scripts a lot for Rails, but I do it very differently.  First, I defined them as Rake tasks.

  I usually just create a data.rake file in lib/tasks.  Any task defined this way can load the whole Rails environment by adding a dependency on the environment task Rails ships with (just add => :environment after your task name).  You can pass data into your tasks, which file to import for example, using environment variables.

  Finally, I would just use FasterCSV (or the standard CSV library) to handle the parsing.  It has all of the features demoed here and much more.

  In short, I feel this is just a little too much boilerplate code.  You are going through too much effort to recreate tools Rails ships with or that are easily downloaded.

  Also, the environment.rb file included with Rails loads boot.rb first thing, so that step in unneeded.  Have a peek at the code.
