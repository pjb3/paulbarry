  Git is the new trendiness.  ;-)  It's worth knowing for that reason alone (because everyone else seems to be using it).

  But I would highly recommend checking out Mercurial and Bazaar (my personal favorite) for slightly different (and, in my opinion, better) takes on the distributed version control.  Bazaar and Mercurial are also much easier to understand and get up to speed on.

  One major thing git has going for it versus the competition: it's *fast*.  But that gap is quickly closing as well.  Bazaar in particular used to be very slow, but their performance tuning efforts prior to releasing version 1.0 paid off.

  Personally, I've been using the bzr-svn plugin for almost everything I coded during the last several months.
