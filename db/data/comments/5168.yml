body: "Thanks for this great resource. I have tried the example, and I can see a membership
  I put in via the dB, but my edits of a user do not reflect any changes to the groups
  I make via the checkboxes. Is there something I am missing? \n\nI just added the
  checkbox code to the existing user edit page I had. Like I said, if I add a membership
  by hand, I see it in the edit page (as a checked box), but when I change a box's
  status it does not update the dB...Not sure why not.\n"
