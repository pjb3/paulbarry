body: "Of course JavaScript is a real language, in fact you could go so far as to
  say JavaScript is a real functional programming language! Its native support of
  closures and higher-order functions puts it in a league that most developers never
  even considered it to be capable of. Not sure if you heard, but the JavaScript projects
  displayed at JSConf will astonish many - Reasonably Smart platform, PhoneGap, Cappuccino
  (NIB->CIB), and many others. There are few other languages with as big of companies
  pumping as much money into its future development. Oh and unlike python and ruby,
  its interpreter has been on every machine since 1996. \n\nBTW - you may want to
  include V8 (google's JS interpreter) in the listing above. http://kourge.net/node/123
  \n\nGreat article and thanks for helping bring awareness!"
