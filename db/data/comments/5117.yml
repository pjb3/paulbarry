body: Thanks Charlie.  I updated the post to include the self.group_ids = nil.  For
  what it's worth, I find myself still using has and belongs to many for things that
  are truly just a set of checkboxes.  In other words, I don't think HABTM is going
  away and it is still useful for some use cases, specifically, when all you want
  is a list of checkboxes.  If you need to store more attributes in the join table,
  then switch to HMT, but when that becomes the case, it's unlikely your interface
  will still just be a set of checkboxes.
