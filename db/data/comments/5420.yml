body: This has topic has crossed my mind a lot since coming over from j2ee and being
  a ruby newbie.  The one thing that I can't wrap my head around is handling concurrent
  users.  If my site consistently has say 2 concurrent users does that mean I need
  to have two rails servers running to be able to adequately support them?
