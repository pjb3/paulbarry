  I spent most of my time working on an Rails app originally developed for 1.2, and hence theres no RESTfulness. At various times on other projects I've tried to use the REST style but always come back to it seeming more complicated than my companies 'old' rails app. I came to rails originally because I liked the simplicity and neatness - REST definately seems to take some of this away.

  As for pretty URLs, this easily is solvable for the important user facing URLs in the routes.rb file - and you get the URLs you want then as well.
