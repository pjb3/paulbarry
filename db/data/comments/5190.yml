body: "Hey Paul, your article really resonated with me.  As previous commenters have
  mentioned, RESTful routes are great when you need a standard resource-based API
  (which we commonly do as we do a lot of Rails CMS's with Flex front-ends, and this
  works wonderfully).  However, I find myself often needing to leave the confines
  of RESTful controllers whenever I need to do something.....well, interesting.\n\nTo
  illustrate (with a very basic example), let's look at reporting interfaces.  A basic
  report takes some user inputs and returns an output.  We're really talking about
  two actions.  I suppose you could squeeze this into the 'new' and 'create' actions,
  but really, this is bastardizing the tenets of REST.  Furthermore, I have no need
  whatsoever for edit/update/destroy/index/show.  I suppose this is handled by a combination
  of RESTful and default routes.  \n\nBut I really was happy to see someone else put
  this out there, as it has bothered me a bit as well.  I guess I just feel that there's
  a lot of hoopla around the idea of \"everything should be RESTful\" that seems to
  be a little misguided.  Then again, maybe I'm just misinterpreting the community
  consensus....\n\n"
