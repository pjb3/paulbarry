  +1, it does matter what URL do you have. I don't like /comments/new?article_id=1, it's ugly

  In your blog you have URLs like http://paulbarry.com/articles/{year}/{month}/{day}/{permalink}
  Why? Why not http://paulbarry.com/articles?id=111 ?

  URLs looks better without question marks, believe me. Also I agree with Thibaud, when you decide to change URLs, you will have to change them in a single place.
