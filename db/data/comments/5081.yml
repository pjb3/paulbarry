body: "I know it's an old post, but I figured I'd throw my two cents in...\n\nLinux
  developers often do XYZ's work for them, creating or altering the drivers to work
  with Linux. \n\nWhen the geeks decide not to upgrade to Vista, the average user
  gets no tech support. When the geeks switch to Ubuntu en masse, the average user
  is drawn closer to Linux. \n\nLinux market share is skyrocketing as of late. Major
  manufacturers are releasing their drivers open source, thus guaranteeing them additional
  market share and lowering their own development costs.\n\nBetween DRM and Piracy,
  commercial software is rapidly dying. The Microsoft business model is not unlike
  the Tobacco industry's: hook'em when they are young, and make it difficult for them
  to leave. The way they make it difficult is to hide the basic functioning of the
  software, making people think they are computer literate when all they really know
  how to do is buy or steal pre-made programs that do what they are trying to do.
  \n\nIn Linux, though, the operation of the machine is quite transparent to an experienced
  user. "
