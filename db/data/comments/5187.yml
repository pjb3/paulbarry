body: I'm with Paul here.  Modules seem to fit more as a way of encapsulating behavior
  for the purpose of reusing it amongst many classes.  Maybe it's a matter of taste,
  but I like the "concerned_with" syntax because it's still connected directly to
  the class that it's part of, so the functionality can remain specific to that class
  rather than being abstracted for inclusion by any class.
