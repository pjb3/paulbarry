  @Paul,
  This is not working for me. What is the "reload" call meant to do? Reset the group_ids attribute to nil?

  When I run this in the console, using the same commands shown in your article, the group_ids attribute persists into the next call to update_groups. This causes trouble when we get to:

  foo.update_attributes(:name => 'foo')

  At this point, group_ids contins [4]. The method then proceeds to delete the memberships to groups 1 and 3.

  I tried adding an assignment "group_ids = nil" at the end of the method, but this doesn't seem to have any effect. That confuses me...
