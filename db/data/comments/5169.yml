body: OK - found my isue thanks to a tail of the development log. Like many people
  I am using restful_authentication (the plugin), and by default the controller uses
  attr_accessible for security. If you (like me) are just getting into Rails and Ruby,
  watch out for this. You must add the group_ids to the list of accessible parameters
  to get the update to work.
