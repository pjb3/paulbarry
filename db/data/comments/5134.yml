  According to the Java Language Specification on String concatenation:
  http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/expressions.html#15.18.1.2, it's possible the compiler will throw out toString() calls if it can.

  It's not in this case because '+=' has no choice but to force toString() to be called on each iteration. In a more likely use case, '+' would be used for string concatenation, and it would be a lot more efficient. I think you would find that StringBuilder and '+' are actually about the same since the toString() calls get thrown out by the compiler.
