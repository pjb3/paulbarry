body: "@James\n\nThanks for the feedback.  Rake tasks might be a better way to go,
  I'll have to try that.  I like using the pipe-separated, because it doesn't require
  any library at all and I kind of just got used to doing in other languages, like
  Perl and Java.  It seems pragmatic to me because doing line.split(\"|\") is so trivial
  and you can do that in any language without relying on a library that may or may
  not be installed.  There might be some cases where FasterCSV would be a good option,
  but using pipe-separated works well in simple cases for me.  \n\nBut as far as the
  boilerplate code, you are right, less code is better code, so I'll look into ways
  of eliminating the unnecessary complication."
