body: Ha! Sorry but your post and then update just cracked me up.  I'm not sure we
  should let this subject rest though.  Let's be real for a minute...Apple DOES get
  away with all kinds of monopolistic ways of doing business.  It's ridiculous the
  amount of hoops you have to go through to do ANYTHING with iTunes.  Have you ever
  lost an iTunes library?  It's hell trying to figure out how to recover it.  Thoughts
  anyone?
