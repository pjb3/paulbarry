body: "nice post... \r\n\r\ni would propose extending the BWIINIL mindset: assume
  that all code you write will be used by someone else, as if all the stuff you write
  is for a third party, or you are writing an SDK for someone else to use.\r\n\r\nit
  will help you question the overall design, think in terms of reusability, and ensuring
  that the public (and even private) interface for your methods is intuitive and well
  thought out.  personally, it has really made me think in terms of smaller units
  of work, making methods more generic (within reason), and avoiding dduplication/copy-paste
  of code.\r\n\r\nif you assume that someone else will be using the code, it strokes
  the ego a bit, too .... who wants to have someone look at their code and say, \"wtf
  is this?!\"\r\n\r\ncoming from a product background, this added time to my initial
  coding, but subsequent releases were easier as i had built up a \"toolbox\" of reusable
  code/components.  my team was able to share a ton, saving a lot work between our
  individual projects.  this applied many platforms, from javascript, to COM components,
  to XSLTs. In the long run, it allowed us to focus on the new business logic, rather
  than reworking the plumbing."
