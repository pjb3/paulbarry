  Renat,

  I'm not sure which part of the discussion you feel is incorrect.  You are correct that lazy loading is a nice feature of Hibernate and other ORM systems like ActiveRecord.  But in some situations, if you know you are going need to use eager fetching to avoid the N+1 select problem.  That doesn't mean you want to completely disable lazy loading for all queries.  This is why ActiveRecord and Hibernate both support eager fetching.

  See this page:
  http://www.hibernate.org/hib_docs/v3/reference/en/html/performance.html#performance-fetching-custom
  Also Eager loading of assocations on this page:
