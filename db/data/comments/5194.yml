body: "Storing files in a database is not really a problem, since most database servers
  have great support for it.\n\nI use this approach to store small thumbnails in my
  database. By using a has_many relation I can easily access my data without loading
  all the Photo data. I only load it when I need it. In combination with the caching
  feature, this is a very acceptable solution. "
