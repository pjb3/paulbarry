body: "I feel that there are advantages and disadvantages of Java, Ruby and Python.
  \ Ruby and Python can allow you to build a site by writing less code, but as the
  site gets more complex, it can be handled.  Take a screen like this for example:\r\n\r\nhttp://stripes.mc4j.org/confluence/download/attachments/525/bulkedit2.png\r\n\r\nHow
  would you build the controller for that in Rails or Django?  I think it would be
  harder to do than the example code given on this page:\r\n\r\nhttp://stripes.mc4j.org/confluence/display/stripes/Sample+Application\r\n\r\nBut,
  you may not have to do complex form handling like that, so then Rails or Django
  might be a good choice."
