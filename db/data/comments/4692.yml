body: "Interesting.  So do you still feel like Ruby or Python offer no real development
  advantages?  Or would advantages show up more after an initial implementation when
  things have to be changed or not?  Just wondering if you've gained in additional
  insights along the way.  Obviously, it's not a real study since you didn't actually
  write the other packages but I'd still be interested to hear more of your thoughts
  on this.\r\n\r\nHow long did it really take?  Any estimate as to the  overall effort?"
