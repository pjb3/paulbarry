  I'm not going to claim that C++ is a great language, or that it gives you the right safety nets, or that it prevents you from shooting yourself in the foot. Let me be abundantly clear about this: C++ is a language full of razors and shards of glass bent on tearing your fragile mind to shreds.

  That said, the C++ templating language does a good job of providing significant metaprogramming functionality on top of static typing by being a Turing-complete language that actually operates on the type system itself. Think of the templating language as a duck-typed dynamic language that is executed at compile time to generate (i.e. metaprogram) the types used by the base C++ code.

  If the templating language sat on top of a nicer statically typed language (honestly can't think of one that doesn't have ugly C legacy), it could be the language you're hoping for.
