body: "I play a minor supportive role in the Hash Rocket (HR) Company. After reading
  your narrative I feel very proud to be involved at any level. \nThe practice of
  bringing in outside sources and talents to expedite client needs has shown me what
  progressive thinking can do for a company, an industry and those directly affected
  by this brilliant move.\nIt shows a confidence of talent that I have never seen
  in the corporate arena. It seems to me that their eagerness to infect the rest of
  the industry with this program pairing would make them easy prey to one-upmanship
  or becoming mediocre in an ever-growing industry.  This is so far from the actual
  that if I did not know the brilliance of the talent employed by HR; I would think
  them arrogant. \nAnyone meeting, working, conversing online or partying with these
  people know them to be so far from arrogant as to almost think them as altruistic,
  earth-muffins.  Willing to give away the shirts off of their backs; just try to
  get a HR t-shirt and experience the tug of war that would make a Labrador with a
  tennis ball blush.\nI joke with others that I have no idea what Obie and the others
  do when locked up in their dark caves from sun up to down. By putting your experience
  online; you have added one more piece of information that others have been unable
  to impart.  \nThank you for sharing your experience with us (me).  Seems that the
  sharing of information is infectious and does nothing but bring good will.  It has
  given to everyone a certain amount of power; you are raised up one level as a teacher
  and I am empowered to understand those around me and what they do when the HR office
  doors close behind them in the mornings.  I am very proud to be involved with these
  fun loving, beautifully talented people that are HR including yourself.  Make no
  mistake: you have been assimilated. \nv/r Peggy"
