  > Unlike with Maybe in Haskell, using exceptions gives you no compile-time (type-checked) guarantee that the exception will be handled. This is, in my mind, the real power of Maybe.

  By using a checked exception, you do get a compile-time guarantee that the exception will be handled.  That was the comparison that I was trying to make in this article.  Until we put some sort of handling of the MaybeNullException into the calling method, the code would not compile.  What am I missing?
