  Agree. Clojure's Java integration certainly provides the "support for threads, filesystem access, processes and IPC, operating system interoperability, a GUI, Unicode, and the long list of other features missing from the latest hyperspec" that Steve Yegge mentions in "Problem 2".

  Towards the end of his <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/04/lisp-is-not-acceptable-lisp.html?showComment=1145178300000#c114517831148492970"> first comment</a> Steve says "I want a language with Python's succinctness, Lisp's extensibility, C's performance, Erlang's parallelism, Java's tools ..." Clojure shows definite promise for all of these.

  He also mentions "Io's orthogonality, and apparently Qi's type system". We might have to ask the man himself to find out how well Clojure satisfies these.
