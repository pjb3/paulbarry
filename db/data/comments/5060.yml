body: "@Maritn\n\nTo clarify my previous comments on Sessions, in order to inject
  a Session into a long-lived Dao, for example, you should set up a request-scoped
  binding from Session.class to your Provider<Session>. Then each time your Dao asks
  its Provider for a Session, you will get the Session that belongs to the current
  request. \n\nThis assumes a one-to-one relationship from Session to web request,
  which is what our app needs. If you have different needs, I imagine you could handle
  them with differnt scoping."
