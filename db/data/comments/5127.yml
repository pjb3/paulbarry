body: "Ahh....so that's what you meant by arbitrarily-keyed hashes.  You mean hashes
  that can have an object of any type as the key.  I agree, that is a nice feature.
  \ Even Java has that, so I guess I've been sort of taking that for granted.\n\nBut
  you are right, the hash rocket will still be needed for hashes with non-symbol keys,
  but also as you said, that won't be nearly as common.  So it will still be supported,
  but won't be idiomatic for symbol-keyed hashes. "
