  Paul, in your <a href="http://paulbarry.com/articles/2007/08/03/habtm-checkboxes">earlier blog entry</a> on this topic, you mentioned use of hidden_field_tag to workaround a limitation in HTML form checkbox. In that case, group_ids can never be nil, right? And therefore the unless check in this example seems redundant?

  Thanks for the excellent explanations!
