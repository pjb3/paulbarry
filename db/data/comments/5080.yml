  This works brilliantly.  A word to anyone who is trying to understand this if you're not actually dealing with users, groups and memberships: it makes things a lot easier if you just cut and paste this entire post into a text editor, then search and replace the terms 'user', 'group', and 'membership' with the actual entities from your system.

  Plus, then the code will work in your application with minimal adjustment.

  Thanks for the help Paul.
