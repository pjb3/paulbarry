body: My take on Git is that the distributed version control is great for open source
  projects, where you have a bunch of people spread out and you want to be able to
  clone a repo, make some kind of experimental change, and then ask the project maintainers
  to take a look.  If you are in a situation where you work in a company that uses
  an internal SVN repository, branches work fine, there is less need for the distributed
  model.
