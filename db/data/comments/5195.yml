  Thank you for the tip. I've developed an alternate approach that works with form_for and preservers the selections after validation fails:

  Your approach definitely has the advantage of simplicity. It would be really great if someone could invent a way to do these checkboxes that's simple, retains selections when validation fails, and works with many-to-many. Perhaps a plugin that uses method_missing and alias_method_chain.
