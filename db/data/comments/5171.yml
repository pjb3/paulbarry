body: "TATFT  \n\nThis is a hard thing to do.  I'll be the first person to admit it.
  \ Another thing that I admit, is that I do *test* all the time.  \n\nSpikin' is
  natural, and a good thing, but after you are done, get rid of all that spikey code
  and TDD the new feature in.  This is hard thing for *all* of us to grasp, because
  it never makes sense at the time.\n\nOne thing of note that I would like to share
  is that sometimes you'll come to a point where you can't TDD.  At that point, I'll
  offer some advice... you most likely don't understand the problem as well as you
  think you do.  What you may need to do is try it again from a different angle or
  maybe you need to think larger and stop scoping so small.\n\nWhatever you do, make
  sure you are testing, because if you aren't, all you are doing is making it harder
  for yourself when you revisit the code, and making it even harder for the next developer
  who will inevitably have to maintain what you just wrote.  \n\nPeace, Hair Grease
  and TATFT"
