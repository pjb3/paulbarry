  I know this isn't the greatest way to work, but I sometimes find myself with a backlog of changes waiting to be committed, and will stage several logical chunks into multiple commits within a span of a few minutes. I've thought about automating time tracking with something like this, but in the end while I'm in flow I just don't want to be bothered worrying about time.

  I do think that storing your time tracking data within the git repo is a great idea, I just haven't thought of the perfect solution for my workflow yet.
