  Good article; I'm a big fan of 1.9 myself.  I also don't think the number of people 'flocking' makes that big of a difference for an unstable version (I remember 1.7):

  The 'hashrocket' use in Hash literals is [at least at this time] still supported, and you can even mix and match, although it's odd:
    { foo: 1, :bar => 2, baz: 3 }
