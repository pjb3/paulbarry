  Thanks Paul,

  I checked around and I'm pretty sure it's returning strings... Its' weird because if I have no Memberships ( Groups ) already defined, I don't think it even goes into the loop... even though I choose two new ones.

  And if the user already has groups, which I call roles, the user is removed from, and then re-added to the same group he was already a member of, regardless of which boxes I check off.

  I should have stuck with HABTM, but now I'm curious.
