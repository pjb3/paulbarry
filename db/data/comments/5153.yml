  Hi,

  Great tutorial, thanks!

  Is there anything in particular I need to do to make:
  @user.groups.include?(group)
  work?

  My tables are calls
  - area_codes
  - markets
  - area_codes_markets

  Adding a new market with a few area_codes works.

  Editing a market fails however. I get the error:

  NameError in Markets#edit
  Showing markets/_form.html.erb where line # raised:
  uninitialized constant Market::AreaCodes

  I traced it down to:
  @market.area_codes.include?(area_code)
  because if I replace that snippet by either 'true' or 'false' the edit page works.

  Might there be a problem with the usage of an underscore ('_') in the table name (i.e. area_codes)?

  Thanks for any help you can give me!
