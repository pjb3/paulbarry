body: "Thank you very much for you post. It was exactly what I was looking for.  I
  started learning Rails two weeks ago.  I don't suppose someone could confirm that
  this is the correct `view` script:\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- users/_form.rhtml -->\r\n<% form_for(@user)
  do |f| %>\r\n\r\n<!-- ... -->\r\n\r\n<%= hidden_field_tag \"user[group_ids][]\",
  \"\" %>\r\n<% for group in group.find(:all) %>\r\n<div>\r\n    <%= check_box_tag
  \"user[group_ids][]\", \r\n        group.id, @user.groups.include?(group) %>\r\n
  \   <%= group.name %>\r\n</div>\r\n<% end %>\r\n\r\n<!-- ... -->\r\n\r\n<% end %>"
