body: I agree. I hate what I do for a living which is why, for the first time in my
  life, am pursuing a career in development instead of just making it my hobby. I
  take pride in what I do at work. But I'm unhappy doing it. I figure if I can take
  pride in something I don't enjoy then I should take even more in something i love.
