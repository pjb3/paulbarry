  Here's an article I just read the other day on this topic:

  http://www.blogmaverick.com/2008/03/28/internet-video-vs-digital-tv/

  While I agree and believe the internet as a medium will open up new and different ways to view content (as it already has), I don't see it ever (at least in the next 10 yrs) realistically competing with television due to (a) quality of video (b) live broadcast issues (c) billions in advertising revenue (d) bandwidth constraints (e) availability to the masses (how many people in this country have high speed internet plus (and computer and technical knowledge to hook it up to a tv) versus people that just have a tv they plug into the wall with a cable hook up.
