body: hey Paul, I've been using Prism (a Mozilla-based project) for this same purpose
  and it works great.  It's really good for things like Google Apps, where I have
  a couple of different accounts; since each Prism app has its own set of cookies,
  this lets me stay logged-in to all my accounts.  Will definitely check this out
  though as it seems a lot farther along than Prism. (http://labs.mozilla.com/2007/10/prism/)
