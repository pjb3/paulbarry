  Hi Paul,

  Thanks for your congratulations. I wrote this book because I think that Stripes is an excellent framework which deserves more attention. What's nice is that I receiving very positive comments about the book, not only about Stripes, but also as a computer book in general.

  Certainly, there are some nice things about Rails, Grails, and friends, but I still think there are certain things that Stripes does better. Furthermore, you *can* use Groovy, JRuby, Clojure, and so on with Stripes. I've used Groovy with Stripes myself with very nice results. On the other hand, unless I'm mistaken, you can't use Java with Rails or Grails.

  To be clear, I'm not down on Rails/Grails/etc., not at all, they are excellent frameworks. But there is a HUGE Java web application base out there and Stripes certainly has its place. The transition to other JVM languages can be made more gradually in a context of a company that's not ready to change to Ruby or Groovy wholesale. And there are many contexts in which Java is still the best choice.

  One of my favorite things about Stripes is that you can do pretty much anything you want with it.

  By the way, keep blogging, you're interesting to read.

  Cheers,
  Frederic Daoud
