body: "You are not missing anything with the iPhone 3G. I got one yesterday and I’m
  not impressed. I have the Motorola s9 >>Bluetooth<< ($100.00) stereo light weight
  headset that will only sync in phone mode not stereo headset with the iPhone. Wow
  my new 3G iPhone suddenly feels broken. I even asked the f***ing question at the
  AT&T store will the iPhone work with the s9 headset (which they sell) and was told
  it would (never only phone mode). The stereo headset works with less expensive phones!!
  I did some reading and found out that I should of done more homework than I did
  before buying.\r\n\r\nhttp://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-9963760-1.html\r\n\r\nSure
  I can buy this appendage (a Bluetooth adapter to make my $300.00 >>>Bluetooth<<<
  iPhone) WORK but what a bulky eye sore JOKE.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.store.motorola.com/mot/en/US/adirect/motorola;jsessionid=0DD9A96E8115B0F3057FC6FA9711D57D.mot3?cmd=catProductDetail&entryPoint=adirect&productID=89147J&messageType=catProductDetail&showAddButton=true\r\n\r\nApple
  bites hence their logo…\r\n"
