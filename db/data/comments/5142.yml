  Good point, for some reason I was thinking that passing no args would mean that args would be nil, but it is an empty array.  I think this is the right implementation:

  args.inject(0){|s,e| s+e.to_i}

  Which allows sum(nil, "1", 2) to return 3, which of course I was easily able to add a test for.  Yay for TDD!
