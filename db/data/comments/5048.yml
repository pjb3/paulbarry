body: "Thanks a lot for the nice example!\nI have one question - how would you go
  about packaging all artifacts? Say, if I wanted to have separate interfaces, implementations
  and consumer (client) JARs - where would you put the Module in and what would be
  the (classpath) dependencies between the jars? Further, what would be the best practice
  for swapping implementations with minimal disruption on the client side, thus providing
  a true transparency of which implementation is currently used? "
