body: Well, I never had thought of a really good way of specifying which collections
  to have eagerly loaded in a non-hibernate specific way.  Looking back on it, passing
  in a collection of Strings does seem pretty obvious, but I hadn't seen that "pattern"
  (if that constitutes a pattern) being used or advocated in Java development.  Rails
  gave me that idea and the Java code I wrote was better and more DRY for it.
