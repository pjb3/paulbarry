body: "@Martin \n\nMy project is using Guice with Hibernate and Webwork. We have very
  simple transaction needs. We declare an interceptor stack for requests that need
  transactions. In that stack, we have an interceptor that starts a txn, passes control,
  then does a commit or rollback as appropriate, protected by a finally block.\n\nIf
  you have more sophisticated txn needs, \n\nFor classes that need Hibernate sessions,
  we either inject the Session through guice or inject a Provider<Session>. You need
  a Provider<Session> if the object you're injecting into has a lifetime that exceeds
  the life of a Session.\n\nFor example, we have long-lived Hibernate Daos that need
  Sessions, and we inject Provider<Session> into the daos.\n\n"
