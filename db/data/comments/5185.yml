body: I'll admit that using RESTful controllers does fatten up your routing a bit,
  but I think that ultimately this makes the entire app come closer to "convention
  over configuration", not farther away from, because in all your controllers you
  have (mostly) the same set of methods and you can depend on them all to do the same
  thing to the resources they are in charge of.  Maybe there is a bit more of a learning
  curve (in fact, I know there is), and I'm not saying you want to use it for everything
  (I have several ajax-y actions in my app that I don't think really relate to resources,
  and so I use a traditional rails route for them), but ultimately I think the extra
  layer is a net gain.
