  Hi,

  for me admin_path("/comments/new", :article_id => @article) isn't DRY, if someday you want modify the url 'comments/new' you're screwed (it's not the case with named routes, where you can just redefine map.new_admin_article_comment). And I really care if the urls are /comments/new?article_id=1 or /articles/1/comments, it's  very very important :-)
