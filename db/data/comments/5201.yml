  I'm really struggling to see why this isn't significantly worse than sticking the code in a module and including it. Isn't it just obfuscation? Why make life harder for people than it already is (by forcing them to learn your new pattern, when it doesn't add anything over and above "include")?

  Just because you can, it doesn't mean you should.
