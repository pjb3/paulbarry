  Sorry, but all your discussion is incorrect. I guess you would need to study Hibernate or any other JPA framework a bit more, because then you will discover that "Lazy loading" is a feature that is very very nice and advanced and brings allot for majority of the cases (in my experience it's usable in 80% of the cases). But in 20% of the cases you don't need it you can centralized disable it. No problems absolutely, no code required, nothing.
  Please consider study Hibernate, it will worth it!
