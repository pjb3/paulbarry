  It's a little cleaner than a module because by opening up the actual user class, you can use exact same syntax.  If you use a module, you have to sort of re-organize things a bit:

  Since there's no reason to re-use this code, there no need for it to be a module.  If there are methods you plan to share across models, then making it a module makes more sense.
