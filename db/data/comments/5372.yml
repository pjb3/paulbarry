body: "hi, so am trying to learn clojure and i've never used emacs before. \nI followed
  the steps but i can get the REPL start in aquamacs.\n\nWhen i open the helloworld.clj
  file i do see that aquamacs identifies the file as clojure file but C-c C-z does
  not launch the REPL.\nIs there a step that i missed?\n\nthanks a lot for the help\n\n\nPS:\njust
  to be sure i chmod clj to 777\nclojure clojure-mode and jlime where installed in
  ~/src\n"
