body: Thanks for the quick intro.  As you say Guice is only meant to provide IoC.  For
  those coming to it from a Spring background this means things such as HibernateDaoSupport
  and HibernateTemplate are lost, along with the correct session injection and transactional
  demaraction.  What strategies are there for dealing with this?  I have not found
  a larger working example of Guice with Hibernate.
