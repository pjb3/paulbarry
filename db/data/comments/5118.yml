  I put this code into my project and for some reason all I'm getting is it'll delete whatever "memberships" the current user already has, and then re-add them... ( on an update... on a create, it skips the loop )

  So it's calling the object's group_ids instead of the parameter being passed by the forum...

  Any idea what could cause this?
