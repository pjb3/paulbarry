  I'm over a year late on this post but damn, this just saved the day today.

  Paul, your code is very clear, the write up is concise and clear as well... just a great post.

  Thanks for taking the time to publish it AND more importantly, thanks for UPDATING the post when people find bugs.

  SO many authors do not do this and it leads to people slamming their face on the desk... my desk is glass and this could be dangerous.
