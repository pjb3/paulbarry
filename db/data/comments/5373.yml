body: I've been using Ruby for a while now, once at a .net shop and now at a pure
  java shop and I'm still not convinced that doing things the Rubyest way is always
  the best idea.  Little things like this can cause a lot of painful debugging to
  someone who's not intimately familiar with the language.  What happened to the days
  of "write clear, obvious code" even at the expense of a couple more lines?  I always
  prefer clarity over terseness.  If I wrote the above I'd feel obligated to write
  a comment explaining the construct anyway.
