body: "I do think Merb can be a strong competitor of Rails on one of the main reasons
  is hosting.  You get more bang for your buck, so to speak with Merb.  People say
  Rails doesn't scale, which isn't true, but it does use more RAM and CPU to scale,
  which has some cost.  Merb will handle requests fast, and more importantly, more
  concurrent requests with less RAM and CPU than Rails, because it is a framework
  designed to be lean and fast.  One of the ways it will be able to do this is because
  it is threadsafe, which Rails is not.\n\nAlso, the Merb team is working on a mod_rubinius,
  which would be an apache module to allow you to setup Merb apps just as easily as
  your can set up PHP.\n\nMerb and DataMapper both have a long way to go to be bug
  free and feature complete with Rails, but that gap is closing everyday.  By this
  time next year, I expect Merb+DataMapper to be being used in a lot of production
  Ruby web application instead of Rails. "
