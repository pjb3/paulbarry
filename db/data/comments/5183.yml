body: "The nice thing about the RESTful routing is once you start using polymorphic
  URL helpers, and liberal application of to_s and to_param, along with nested resources.
  \ You can end up with some wickedly beautiful URLs, along with nice and clean template
  code generating your links.\n\nSuddenly, your links are only\n\n<%= link_to comment,
  [ article, comment ] %>\n\nThat'll use to_s for the text of the link, and it'll
  find the route for a the article, and then its nested comment.  \n\nYou don't have
  to know or care about the names of your routes. \n\nSame goes for the RESTful actions.
  \ To delete a comment, you do something similar to\n\n<%= link_to comment, [ article,
  comment ], :method=>:delete %>\n\nNice and smooth."
