body: Another great article. One thing to clarify is that the kaboom is not from out
  of memory available for the call stack. In JavaScript, the call stack is limited
  by instruction depth regardless of memory usage. Its a hard and fast limiter on
  processing depth, unfortunately. A case in point using the recommended accumulator
  technique can be shown using a large value for both n and p, even the values are
  clearly processable in the memory allocated. In Firefox, odds(2999, 8000) returns
  an InternalError because the stack limit has been exceed, not necessarily the memory
  limit. Safari fails at odds(100000,100000) Full lists of stack size limits at http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2009/05/19/javascript-stack-overflow-error/
  (note that newer WebKit runtimes have a lot higher threshold).
