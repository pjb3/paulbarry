  Commented before I read the full post. Just wanted to add that I think this post doesn't really make explicit why the lambda is necessary in this case.

  You could do
  named_scope :published_before, :conditions => ["published_at < ?", Time.now.beginning_of_year]
  but the time would be set at define-time, and not be calculated on each run; with a lambda, on the other hand, it's calculated each time it's run.
