  Gotta love git. Sometimes I even do those first steps as a oneliner from my local shell:

    ssh remotehost.com "mkdir -p ~/git/project_name.git && cd ~/git/project_name.git && git --bare init"

  git is so easy to start with, I almost always `git init` after I make a new folder for code, even if its for some quick experimentation. Helpful when those things grow.
