  Are you sure group_ids is set to an array of strings?  If you set group_ids to array of integers, that will cause it to delete and re-add.  I would suggest just doing a little debugging in the method.  If it's deleting records it shouldn't be, group_ids.include?(m.group_id.to_s) must be false for some reason.
