  Paul,

  I agree with what you said. To answer your question, yes you can use Groovy with Stripes. As I said in my previous comment, I've used Groovy with Stripes myself with very nice results. Groovy supports annotations, so it's not a problem. As I'm sure you know, using Groovy allows you to get things done with less code and more concise syntax.

  I don't know if Stripes would work with JRuby, haven't tried that out yet.
