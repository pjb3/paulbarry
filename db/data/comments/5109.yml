  It's not strictly true it only happens in two cases. instance_eval and class_eval also change self:

  class Test
  end

  p self
  Test.new.instance_eval do
    p self
  end

  Though these ones are fairly obvious, beware of the situations where people do "some_object.instance_eval { yield }" behind your back, as "self" may not be what you think it should be within a block you pass to a method.
