body: 'I got my copy when it was finished last month.  I think it''s a valuable resource
  but it''s missing the one thing that would make it critical: a function reference
  at the back like with the Pickaxe.  It would have added a very useful 100-200 pages
  to the book.  I hope they consider doing this for any 2nd ed that might be published.'
