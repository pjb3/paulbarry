  I've listened to a number of tech podcasts from time to time, but two stand out:

  #1: Software Engineering Radio: http://www.se-radio.net/

  This show is, in my estimation, head and shoulders above anything else out there.  The hosts clearly try very hard to research and understand the technology they are going to be interviewing their guest on.  And they make a deliberate effort at breadth of coverage, which results in a less insular view of the world than most tech podcasts seem to have.  They've covered everything from cutting-edge dynamic languages to hardcore research static languages; realtime embedded to distributed enterprise systems; agile practices and OO/UML design, etc.  Highly recommended.

  #2. For general tech news, not specifically having to do with software, I like CNet's "Buzz Out Loud" podcast.  The hosts strike the right balance between well-informed and snarky.
