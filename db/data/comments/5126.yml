  Unless I am much mistaken, the hash rocket is neither deprecated nor un-idiomatic.  The new syntax is sugar for a very specific kind of hash: the kind where all the keys are Symbols.  Granted, this is a pretty common usage of Hash, especially in Rails.  But hashes are still going to support keys of arbitrary types, for which the hash rocket remains necessary.

  And thank goodness. You don't appreciate arbitrarily-keyed hashes until you work in a language without them, like Perl (strings only) or Python (immutables only).  This is IMO one of the great unsung design choices of Ruby.
