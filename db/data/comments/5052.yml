  seeing a dao class interface that has methods like this, eg:

  findWithComments(long objectId)
  findWithCommentsAndFoo(long objectId)
  findWithCommentsAndBar(long objectId)
  findWithCommentsAndBarAndFoo(long objectId)

  every programmer who is worth their money, no matter if he/she has ever used ActiveRecord, should see that this should be handled by just one method and the part behind comments should be passed in as a parameter. The code in the Method should look alike except for the propertyname which is passed to hibernate for eager fetching. so its obvious to single that out as a method-parameter, or you violate DRY principles.
