  Out of curiousity, since this is the first real useage of liquid outside of 'hi Tobi' kind of tutorials....

  I keep reading the propaganda for liquid from 2006, i'm sure you've seen it.  Where they mention 'if you want to sever your templates from the database'.

  Do you use liquid often?  Can you serve them from a db?  Other then the security factor, which is big, what advantages are there to liquid over erb, or even just a good css file?  i mean if you don't want a user to mess with any ruby but want to allow a user to upload css files to an asset server or something?

  liquid from a db, and having the user's site admin select a db housed template, would be great... just ain't no info on it.  thoughts?
