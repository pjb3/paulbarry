body: "Hibernate also allows you to set a batch size, so that rather than N+1 selects
  you have (N/batchSize)+1 selects.  Which often translates to 1+1 selects, which
  is really not a problem.\r\n\r\nAlso, Seam (my preferred Java framework, although
  there are many to choose from) does a fantastic job of persisting the database session
  for the whole page rendering, so lazy loading is a thing of the past.  Other simple
  techniques (threadLocals, et cetera) are also well known solutions to that problem."
