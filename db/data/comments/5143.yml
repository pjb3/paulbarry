body: "@James: For some import routines, a CSV import is going to be fine. But there
  are lots of cases where a simple CSV import isn't going to work, and in those cases,
  having a more controllable method for doing imports, like this one, will be quite
  useful.\n\nFor example, I am importing a data file provided by a vendor. One line
  per record is what they provide, but I need to break out the data into multiple
  associated records. E.g., each line in the vendor-provided file is a catalog item,
  but I need item, manufacturer, and individual sku (think variation or edition) records.
  Worse, sometimes there is more than one manufacturer, all in the same field, separated
  by \" and \" when there are two, and separated by \", \" when there are more than
  two. \n\nIn other words, sometimes you get clean data that can cleanly import. Other
  times, you gotta massage the data before you can create records for it. In that
  case, this method is going to work, and the CSV libraries are going to cry like
  babies."
