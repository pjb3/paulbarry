  A super neat and useful bit of python is that you can use zip and the explode operator * to transpose a matrix:

  >>> x = [[1,1],
  ...      [0,1]]
  >>> x
  [[1, 1], [0, 1]]
  >>> zip(*x)
  [(1, 0), (1, 1)]

  Though it's not useful in ruby, because [] has a transpose method, you can do the same thing:

  >> x = [[1,1],[0,1]]
  => [[1, 1], [0, 1]]
  >> x[0].zip *x[1..-1]
  => [[1, 0], [1, 1]]

  I add it just to note an important use of zip()s in general.
