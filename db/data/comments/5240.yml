body: The point of that excerpt from the book is not that all testing goes away.  Sure,
  refactoring may introduce tons of logic bugs, but in a statically typed language,
  most, if not all, type bugs will not exist at runtime.  And refactoring many times
  includes changing the type of an interface parameter.  I think dynamically typed
  lanugages have there place, I'm a big fan of clojure.   I just don't see how large  projects
  with lots of collaborators, could be practical without static typing. I think smaller
  projects with small teams are where dynamic languages make sense.
