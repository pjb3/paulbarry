  In my pastie, I extend the user model with authentication validations.  How exactly would you do that with a module?

  module UserStuffs
    def self.included(base)
      base.validates_presence_of :foo
    end
  end

  Yuck.

  But if you're relying on this too much, you may be in danger of bloating your models too much (and neither 'concerns' nor modules will help you out here)
