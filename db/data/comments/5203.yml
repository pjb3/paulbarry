  I think this is a good idea. Don't let the above detractors discourage you. Yes it is like doing an include but I feel that this is cleaner. My only concern is performance. I'm going to work with it and see if it affects the speed too much.

  @the_detractors
  What is the difference between this and using named_scope, has_many, many of the lamba shortcuts, orany other shortcuts or tricks? This is just a cleaner way of only editing what you need, and finding the place to edit faster. I see no reason not to take this approach. This falls much more into the category of doing things the rails way; whereas the other way is a lot more in line with the ruby way.
