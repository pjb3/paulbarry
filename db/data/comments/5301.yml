  Another thing to note about why Maybe works well in Haskell is that type signatures in Haskell are inferred if you leave them out, so if you get tired of writing them, you can just let the compiler work it out (it still checks the inferred types).

  Still, it's considered good practice to write type signatures for top-level things, and especially things which are exported from a module, but Maybe doesn't seem like much of a burden there. It's only 5 characters and expresses clearly the intent that there might be no value to be had.
